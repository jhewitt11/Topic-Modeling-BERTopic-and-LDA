    "5 Reasons For Democrats To Still Be Concerned About The Midterms": [
        "By Nate Silver",
        " Last week, I argued that there weren\u2019t yet clear signs of a Republican comeback in polls of the midterm elections. This week? The case for a GOP rebound is a little better. For one, Republicans can cite some individual polls that have been favorable for them. There was a poll this weekend from ABC News1 and the Washington Post, which found Republicans 5 points ahead on the generic congressional ballot among likely voters \u2014 a result which would all but assure the GOP of winning the House and make the Senate an uphill battle for Democrats. Republican candidates have also pretty clearly gained ground in some individual Senate races, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. There are counterexamples, though. Another highly rated pollster, Selzer & Co., published a poll this week showing Democrats 4 points ahead on the generic ballot among likely voters. Meanwhile, Democrats can cite a few strong recent Senate polls of their own in states such as Ohio and New Hampshire. Overall, Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the Senate are 68-in-100, according to the Deluxe version of our forecast. That\u2019s down from a high of 71-in-100, which persisted from Sept. 13 to Sept. 20, though that change isn\u2019t large in the big scheme of things. In the House, Democrats\u2019 chances are 31-in-100, which reflects an even smaller change; their chances were 32-in-100 on Sept. 23 and 24. Still, we\u2019re overdue for a reminder of why Republicans still could do quite well for themselves in November. So here are five major reasons for hope for the GOP \u2014 and concern for Democrats.\u00a0 As an added twist, we\u2019ll engage in a bit of model talk as we review these reasons. That is, I\u2019ll tell you whether I think these reasons for hope/concern (depending on who you\u2019re rooting for) are adequately accounted for by our model \u2014 or whether they reflect information outside of its scope and assumptions. Sure, this election could be an exception to the usual midterm pushback against the president\u2019s party. But, it\u2019s not always smart to bet on exceptions. So it\u2019s worth going back over the reasons why I and other analysts initially expected this election to be a strong one for Republicans.\u00a0 Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Yes. The Classic and Deluxe versions of our model use a blend of polls and fundamentals when evaluating the overall political environment and individual races.2 This makes a pretty big difference in the House, where our Lite forecast, which tries to predict the race based on polls alone, gives Republicans a 61-in-100 chance of a House takeover. Those odds jump to 68-in-100 percent in the Deluxe forecast, which takes fundamentals into account. This also boosts the odds of Republicans, who have a 23-in-100 chance of winning the Senate in Lite but a 32-in-100 chance in Deluxe. The differences between the forecasts were larger at earlier points in the cycle; there isn\u2019t as much time left now for the polls to converge toward the fundamentals. Still, the model assumes that Republicans are more likely to gain ground than to lose ground in the polls between now and November. This is the argument recently advanced by Nate Cohn of The New York Times. During the summer, Democrats benefited from media and voter attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Jan. 6 hearings, and the FBI investigation of former President Donald Trump. These issues tend to remind voters of Republican power and influence and potentially make the election more of a 2020-like choice between Democrats and Republicans and less of a referendum on Biden and Democrats\u2019 performance. But now, issues like immigration and the economy are again getting more headlines. That\u2019s not to say abortion and those other issues won\u2019t matter, but the summer could have reflected a best-case scenario for Democrats. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Not exactly. The model accounts for uncertainty due to future news events. But it doesn\u2019t make any assumptions about whether these surprises tend to benefit one party over another. But \u2026 I\u2019d be careful overthinking this. People who cover politics for a living, including me, live in a bubble full of people who pay far more attention to day-to-day political developments than regular voters do. Pundits\u2019 guesses about which stories voters will care about, or how they will affect their voting preferences, are often wrong. Moreover, the life cycle of stories tends to be pretty short. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s decision to send immigrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard was a huge story until about a week ago, but now we have a devastating hurricane and a new wave of economic concerns that have usurped it. So in practice, assuming that future news events create uncertainty in both directions will usually be the best course. If I were actually betting on election outcomes at prediction markets \u2014 and no, I don\u2019t do that for a variety of reasons! \u2014 I\u2019d pay attention to the flow of campaign advertising. Advertising may not matter that much in terms of moving votes in an era with relatively few swing voters. But it certainly matters some, and the effects can be short-lived. So if one candidate had a temporary edge on their airwaves, it might lead to a temporary surge in the polls, which would then recede. So one potential source of concern for Democrats would be if they\u2019d dominated the advertising race during the summer, but only temporarily. Is this happening? I honestly don\u2019t know. There are some accounts of Republican groups having boosted spending recently. But while public fundraising and campaign spending is relatively easy to track, outside spending also plays a large role and is more opaque. Moreover, outside spending has tended to favor conservatives and Republicans this cycle. With that said, not every dollar is spent equally well. Outside groups don\u2019t get the same favorable advertising rates that campaigns themselves do, and it\u2019s cheaper to buy ads in advance rather than at the last minute. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Not really. The model doesn\u2019t make any assumptions at all about advertising. It doesn\u2019t discount or adjust a poll because it came during an advertising blitz, for example. Nor does it make any assumption about future advertising spend. The model does account for fundraising; money raised from individual donors is one of the factors that the model evaluates in addition to the polls. But this is more because fundraising tends to be a proxy for grassroots support rather than because of any additional advertising leverage it provides. One reason that the aforementioned ABC News poll was so worrying for Democrats is because of the relatively large enthusiasm differential it showed between registered voters \u2014 among whom Democrats trailed on the generic ballot by only 1 percentage point \u2014 and likely voters, among whom they trailed by 5. That 4-point \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d was somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 midterms, when there was roughly a 6-point gap between polls of registered and likely voters, leading to a catastrophic election for Democrats. But other polls do not show the same enthusiasm disadvantage for Democrats. As Cohn mentions, for instance, there was only a 1-point enthusiasm gap in The New York Times\u2019s recent generic ballot polling. Other polls in the wake of the Dobbs decision found that while Republicans were more excited than usual to vote at the midterms, so were Democrats. Democrats have also tended to have strong turnout in recent special elections and ballot referendums. The consensus of the evidence points toward a modest enthusiasm gap favoring Republicans \u2014 enough to make matters harder for Democrats, especially in the House \u2014 but nothing like the magnitude of 2010. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Yes, the model explicitly accounts for the likely GOP enthusiasm advantage. Specifically, it adjusts polls of registered voters to make them equivalent to polls of likely voters. Initially, this adjustment is based on historical patterns: Republican voters have historically been more likely to turn out than Democratic ones, and voters of the opposition party are more likely to turn out than voters from the president\u2019s party.3 In 2018, those factors offset one another (Republicans had the traditional enthusiasm advantage, but Democrats were the opposition party). But this year, they\u2019re both working in the GOP\u2019s favor. I can also see an argument that this assumption is too generous to Republicans, though. Voters at the midterms tend to be older, whiter and more well-educated than voters in presidential years. Historically, these factors all tended to favor Republicans. Now, however \u2014 while Republicans are still older and whiter \u2014 Democrats tend to dominate among college-educated voters, who are considerably more likely to turn out to vote.  Let me put this carefully. Two weeks ago, I wrote about why I don\u2019t agree with the presumption that polls \u2014 despite their shortcomings in 2016 and 2020 \u2014 are biased toward Democrats:  There are a lot of qualifications here. It doesn\u2019t mean that the polls can\u2019t have a bad year. But the idea behind the FiveThirtyEight model is that they\u2019ll be biased toward Democrats in some years, they\u2019ll be biased toward Republicans in some years, and they\u2019ll be unbiased in some years \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re getting ahead of time. I\u2019ve read various rebuttals to this article, some of which I find a little lacking. For instance, I simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to claim, as Andrew Prokop recently did in Vox, that polls overestimated Democratic performance in 2018.4 To treat anti-Republican bias in the polls as a sort of inescapable empirical regularity based on a sample of two election cycles, neither of which was the most recent midterm, is making too much of limited evidence. But does that mean I give no credence at all to what we might call the Predictable Democratic Polling Bias (PDPB) hypothesis? No, of course not. Good fox-like forecasters can hold multiple ideas or hypotheses in their head at once. PDPB has some things going for it. My mental model of the race might be something like: mostly the FiveThirtyEight forecast, but with a little smidge of weight that PDPB is real. What\u2019s the case for PDPB? Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an empirical one. Empirically, the evidence strongly shows that polling bias is unpredictable. But the theoretical case that analyst Richard Hanania makes for PDPB in his recent Substack post is plausible. If, fundamentally, Republicans are less likely to answer surveys because (for instance) they have lower social trust, that\u2019s not necessarily an intractable problem. But it could be one that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet. It could take pollsters a couple of election cycles to work out the right approach, especially if it requires abandoning traditional polling best practices. Interestingly enough, PDPB wouldn\u2019t necessarily doom Democrats in the Senate. Even if polls had a 3-point pro-Democratic bias, Democrat John Fetterman would still be favored in Pennsylvania, where he leads by 6 points in our polling average. Democratic incumbents Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada would technically be underdogs (they currently lead by 2.1 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively). But Georgia and Nevada have had fairly accurate polling in recent years. Any amount of PDPB would doom Democrats\u2019 chances in the House, however. Does the FiveThirtyEight model account for this? Sort of. Although the model doesn\u2019t assume any sort of permanent polling bias, it does give some weight to the fundamentals, and as I mentioned above, the fundamentals are more favorable to Republicans than the polls alone. The Deluxe forecast also considers expert ratings, and although how it uses these ratings is slightly complicated (read the methodology section for more), those do help Republican odds in the Senate. Perhaps if you give a little bit of extra mental weight to PDPB, it would be enough to account for the relatively small differences between the FiveThirtyEight forecast and betting markets. For instance, betting markets give Republicans a 39 percent chance of winning Senate control, as compared to 31 percent in our Deluxe forecast, and a 75 percent chance of House control, instead of 68 percent. Those are small enough differences that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make huge bets on either side.",

    "Iranians Are Ready For A Different Approach to Religion and Government": [
        "By Zoha Qamar",
        " Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Protests in Iran have been raging on for nearly two weeks because 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the \u201cmorality police\u201d after she allegedly failed to comply with the nation\u2019s veiling laws. The protests that began on the streets of Saqqez, her hometown, have now spread to roughly 80 cities across the nation, as Iranian women lead demonstrations in defiance of a law that mandates they cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothes while in public. At least 76 people have died, although the toll is likely higher as internet restrictions have made information harder to confirm.  Amini\u2019s death may have sparked this recent uprising, but data shows Iranian opposition toward required veiling isn\u2019t new. The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran, a Netherlands-based research foundation, conducted a comprehensive study in 2020 on Iranians\u2019 opinions about religion and found that a whopping 72 percent of literate Iranians over age 191 disagreed with the government mandating that women wear the hijab in public, compared with only 15 percent who agreed with it. Over the years, those who have subverted the law have faced violent beatings and, in the case of Amini, fatal consequences at the hands of the government.\u00a0 These events have brought a simmering question to a boil: In a world increasingly secular and interconnected, what role do people think theology should play in determining law?\u00a0 While Iran is now associated with mandatory veiling, that was not always the case. In 1936, the penultimate shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, decreed a ban on hijab in an attempt to promote European attire. Women who failed to comply with this prior law similarly faced punishments, such as imprisonment. The newer mandate, which Iranians are protesting now, was implemented when the pro-Western, secular monarchy was replaced with an Islamic theocracy after the 1979 revolution.  First, the veil was banned, and now it\u2019s mandatory. But once again, most Iranians are proponents of change \u2014 not just for hijab law but also for the role of religion in government more broadly. Only 22 percent of literate Iranians over age 192 believe an Islamic republic is the most suitable governing structure for their country, according to a survey by GAMAAN conducted in February. Meanwhile, in a separate question, 88 percent agreed that having a democratic system would be a good idea.\u00a0 Also in that study, two-thirds said they did not want a government run according to religious law, which challenges the inherent premise of the country\u2019s current governing structure. In contrast, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study, half of all Americans thought the Bible should have at least some bearing on the law, despite this nation\u2019s principles separating church and state.\u00a0 In the decades since its 1979 revolution, Iran has faced its fair share of political uprisings \u2014 due to claims of rigged elections and soaring gas prices, for example. But this current political moment has uniquely united Iranian women across socioeconomic, ethnic and regional lines. Furthermore, the recent demonstrations are not simply a protest of the current ruling politicians but also one that challenges how religion underpins the law overall.  Outside of Iran, however, the global trend has been toward repression of religion in the public sphere. Pew has tracked government limitations on religion since 2007. According to data published in 2021, Pew found that the global level of politically affiliated religious restriction was higher than it had been for most of the prior decade. Meanwhile, the history of Iran shows that both forced and forbidden faith can lead to dangerous consequences for citizens.  The ongoing internet shutdowns will likely keep international eyes from seeing everything happening in Iran, including the government\u2019s violence toward those speaking up. But quashing protests will not necessarily mean quashing dissent. Although Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s current supreme leader, has long posited outside influences, especially the U.S., as the greatest threat to his rule, this moment suggests that Iran\u2019s own citizens \u2014 and its women in particular \u2014 could present a huge challenge to the power of theocracy. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker,3 42.0 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 52.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.2 points). At this time last week, 42.5 percent approved and 53.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -10.5 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 42.4 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -11.0 points. In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot,4 Democrats currently lead Republicans by 1.3 points (45.3 percent to 44.1 percent). A week ago, Democrats led by 1.9 points (45.2 percent to 43.3 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 0.5 points (44.3 percent to 43.8 percent).",

    "How Waffle House Helps Us Respond To Hurricanes": [
        "By Maryn McKenna",
        " This 2016 story followed a team of Waffle House operations analysts as they decided whether to close any of the chain\u2019s locations in preparation for Hurricane Matthew, a Category 5 storm that ended up affecting the Florida coast as a Category 2 storm. This week, as at least 21 Waffle House locations in Florida closed due to Hurricane Ian, we thought we should revisit what happens when the famously resilient restaurant shuts its doors for a storm \u2014 and why even the federal government pays attention when it does.\u00a0 On a warm, cloudy morning in the first week of October, in an anonymous office park just outside Atlanta, operations analyst Matt Stark opened a computer program, ran through some data and looked thoughtfully at the results. Out in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Matthew was hurling winds of 115 miles an hour toward the coast of Florida. Hundreds of miles inland, in the headquarters of Waffle House Inc., Stark\u2019s software predicted that 477 of the chain\u2019s almost 1,900 restaurants might be affected by the onrushing storm. This meant two things. First, as the storm made landfall, some locations of Waffle House \u2014 which boasts that every restaurant stays open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year \u2014 would probably have to close because of power loss or concerns for workers\u2019 safety. And second, sometime after they did, someone would invoke the \u201cWaffle House Index,\u201d the slightly flippant measure of how bad a storm can get. And Matthew brought on both those expected scenarios. Waffle House announced Oct. 6 that it was pre-emptively closing some restaurants on a 90-mile stretch of Interstate 95 between Fort Pierce and Titusville in Florida. (In the next few days, as the storm churned up the coast and flooded North Carolina, it would close 98 all told.) And as soon as the announcement went out, media tracking the storm, and customers on social media, invoked the closings as a sign of the apocalypse. The Miami Herald: \u201cWhen Waffle House surrenders to a hurricane, you know it\u2019s bad.\u201d The Washington Post: \u201cHurricane Matthew is so scary even the always-open eatery is evacuating.\u201d A faithful customer on Twitter: \u201cGOD IN HEAVEN THIS IS THE END!\u201d In those areas, the Waffle House Index had just gone to red. Disaster responders pay attention to that index, which was created \u2014 in the midst of 2004\u2019s devastating Hurricane Charley \u2014 by W. Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency since 2009. Fugate was director of emergency management for Florida when Charley slammed the state with unexpected force: Its winds strengthened abruptly and it went from a Category 2 to a Category 4, and the storm suddenly changed direction and struck the state\u2019s Gulf Coast at Sanibel, 150 miles south of its predicted landfall. Tens of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless. Fugate was in his office with state meteorologist Ben Nelson and members of the Florida National Guard, color-coding infrastructure loss on a map \u2014 green for operating, yellow for affected, and red for destroyed \u2014 and the group decided to take a look at some of the damage, and try to find a meal. \u201cThey went to a Waffle House and noticed they had a limited menu, with nonperishable items,\u201d Alexa Lopez, FEMA\u2019s press secretary, told me. \u201cThe next day, they were driving around and they went to a different Waffle House, and the same thing happened, a limited menu.\u201d So, she said, the group was inspired first to rank Waffle Houses in the same way: green for fully operational, yellow for a limited menu and red for closed. \u201cWhich is pretty bad, because Waffle House is always open,\u201d Lopez added. And, second, to use those observations as a proxy for how much a disaster disrupts a community. Fugate has since been quoted as saying: \u201cIf you get there and the Waffle House is closed? That\u2019s really bad. That\u2019s where you go to work.\u201d The concept of restaurant operations as an indicator of storm impact percolated slowly into emergency-management culture \u2014 the magazine Environment Health Safety Today wrote about it in July 2011 \u2014 and broke out into the open around the time of Hurricane Irene in August 2011 (when, according to The Wall Street Journal, 22 Waffle Houses lost power but only one stayed closed longer than a day). But the so-called index isn\u2019t actually an official metric. FEMA doesn\u2019t publish it anywhere; no one, except for Waffle House itself, counts how many restaurants are running lean or forced to close. But the company does give that count to the agency, and FEMA uses it \u2014 along with wind speeds and power outages and other objective measures \u2014 to judge a storm\u2019s impact, and to figure out where its own crews and other emergency responders can get fed. So far, so obvious: If a storm is bad enough to close restaurants that \u201cnever close,\u201d we can agree that storm is bad. Hurricane Matthew was the strongest storm of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, which ended Nov. 30. But the Waffle House Index also stands for something less obvious. It is an indicator of how complex and long supply chains are \u2014 for food, for fuel, for power \u2014 and of what it takes to plan around infrastructure that can be fragile in unexpected ways. \u201cThe essence of the index is not just that the situation is bad,\u201d Panos Kouvelis, director of the Boeing Center for Supply Chain Innovation at Washington University in St. Louis, told me. \u201cCompanies like Waffle House, and Wal-Mart and Home Depot, operate in areas that are frequently hit by disasters, where their operations may go down at the same time the demand for their services go up. So they have had to develop very well-defined playbooks for being prepared.\u201d But preparation is a complicated endeavor in an economy where few things are sold in the places where they were made. Vanilla comes from Madagascar. The United States imports most of its salt. The plywood needed to protect windows from storm debris might have been manufactured in China, and a storm in the Gulf of Mexico can force enough interruption on petroleum refining to choke off supply on the other side of the country. \u201cWhen I talk to companies about whether they understand their supply chains, they generally know one step up and back: who they buy from and who they sell to,\u201d said Amy Kircher, director of the Food Protection and Defense Institute at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that there are five or 10 steps in the chain before the product reaches them. Or that the alternate suppliers they consider their contingency plan are all buying from the same place.\u201d At Waffle House headquarters in November, Stark and his colleagues on the chain\u2019s storm team \u2014 Vice Presidents Pat Warner and Will Mizell and Communications Director Kelly Thrasher-Bruner, who handles social media in disasters \u2014 walked me through how they prepare. As we talked, Stark pulled up an updated post-Matthew map. Of 200 restaurants that ended up in the storm\u2019s path, just one, in inland North Carolina, gleamed red, for \u201cstill affected\u201d; it had been flooded and needed cleaning out. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for us to shut down, because we\u2019re not used to turning everything off and turning the lights off and closing the door,\u201d said Warner, who estimates that he has worked \u201cmore than 10\u201d hurricane responses in 17 years. \u201cSo our goal is to open up as quickly as possible afterward. The operations team works with the distributor to get food ready to go in. The construction team lines up generators. If you have generators you have to have fuel, so we line up that.\u201d On the edge of the predicted storm zone \u2014 which Stark monitors from a temporary \u201cwar room\u201d assembled by putting mobile giant screens in a conference room \u2014 the company positions personnel who can swoop in: carpenters, electricians, IT specialists, a food-safety expert and someone to talk to local governments and law enforcement and soothe concerns about curfews. A little farther out, restaurants in other markets line up \u201cjump teams\u201d: spare personnel who volunteer to work in place of locals who might have evacuated or might need to repair their homes or care for family. In Hurricane Matthew, the company sent in an extra 250 people. \u201cWe say we throw chaos at chaos,\u201d Mizell said. \u201cWe just throw a lot of resources down there to get restaurants open. Our CEO will be there. In Matthew, our chairman was there, too.\u201d Before the carpenters and computer specialists or the replacement cooks and servers arrive, the company assesses how long it has been since supplies were delivered and \u2014 just as crucial \u2014 how long since the local trash removal company last emptied the dumpster. \u201cMost restaurants get a delivery once a week,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIf it got there Wednesday and the storm hits Thursday, they should have enough food, but if the storm hits Tuesday, we may have to hurry up and get some food there.\u201d Waffle House uses one main distributor, Illinois-based US Foods, which has depots scattered across the Southeast, where most Waffle Houses are concentrated, and where many hurricanes that strike the U.S. make landfall. So supplies don\u2019t need to travel far in advance of a storm and are close by once roads are clear. That model of staging supplies and personnel in layers outside an emergency, in order to swoop in quickly once it abates, isn\u2019t unique to Waffle House. It\u2019s also followed by the military and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which oversees the Strategic National Stockpile of emergency medications, vaccines and antidotes for natural disasters and biological attacks. \u201cWe think about, What are the timelines in which people have to be provided medications?\u201d Greg Burel, the stockpile\u2019s director, told me. \u201cOur primary stock is laid down in undisclosed locations around the country that give us access to large swaths of the population and that are accessible\u201d by more than one type of transportation. But the CDC also puts smaller, lighter assets \u2014 the equivalent of a temporary field hospital or a stash of medications that could be deployed immediately \u2014 \u201cas far forward as we can if we have advance notice, but not so far forward that it becomes victim to that event,\u201d Burel said. The first rule of operating in a disaster, though, is keeping personnel safe. Every Waffle House employee gets a key fob with lists of relevant phone numbers. Local managers keep track of who has challenging home situations \u2014 disabled parents, children with special needs, single heads of household \u2014 and might need extra help. Every location has a wall-mounted \u201ccrisis response\u201d flier that includes detachable wallet cards listing personal-preparedness steps for hurricanes, tornadoes and ice storms. The cards also remind employees how needed they will be at work. \u201cWe will be very busy,\u201d the current hurricane-preparedness card says, \u201cand you will make lots of money!\u201d Once employees arrive or return and a location can open, they work through the storm manual: a giant binder, a kind of choose-your-own-adventure game composed in eggs and grits. \u201cHere\u2019s how you run the restaurant if you\u2019re without power, without gas for the grills, without water,\u201d Mizell said. \u201cWe can cook on the grills even if we don\u2019t have electricity. We can bring in bottled water and canned Coke products and serve on to-go plates. We can get porta-potties.\u201d The storm team examines what worked and didn\u2019t after every disaster, each time learning new lessons. In Hurricane Katrina \u2014 when they closed 107 locations in Mississippi and on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain \u2014 roads were so bad they stashed supplies in a refrigerated semi-trailer with armed guards, and fuel so scarce they brought in their own tank trucks. When Katrina struck in 2005, Twitter had not yet launched; now Bruner uses it not just to alert customers to closings, but to crowdsource whether roads are open and where the power is on. Waffle House began working on storm response before Katrina \u2014 Warner said he thinks the first organized attempt was Hurricane Hugo, which hit Charleston, South Carolina, in September 1989 \u2014 but from then to now, the company\u2019s biggest need in disasters hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cPeople,\u201d Warner said. \u201cWe can get the food there, by hook or by crook. It costs more, but we\u2019re willing to spend it. But if we don\u2019t have people, we can\u2019t open up.\u201d",

    "Democrats Need More Than Beto O\u2019Rourke If They Want To Flip Texas": [
        "By Alex Samuels",
        " Once again, everyone can\u2019t stop talking about Beto O\u2019Rourke.  FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling average1 shows a single-digit contest in the Texas gubernatorial race between O\u2019Rourke and the Republican incumbent, Greg Abbott. Earlier this year, O\u2019Rourke made headlines for his record-breaking fundraising, and the fallout from a succession of high-profile events in the state \u2014 the triggering of a preexisting state law banning abortions, continued strains on the power grid and a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history \u2014 are giving him unexpected leverage against Abbott. As a result, this gubernatorial election could be one of Texas\u2019s most competitive since Democrats last held the office in the 1990s.  Let\u2019s be real about one thing, though: The overall electoral environment might be improving for Democrats, but O\u2019Rourke is still a serious long shot. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s 2022 midterm-election forecast2 gives Abbott a 95-in-100 chance of besting his ubiquitous Democratic challenger. But is it possible that after his closer-than-expected Senate race against Ted Cruz in 2018 and rise to national prominence after a nearly eight-month campaign in the 2020 presidential election, a narrow loss against Abbott in November could be a victory for Texas Democrats in the long run? The idea that O\u2019Rourke could be laying the groundwork for future Democratic victories in Texas isn\u2019t a crazy one. After all, other Southern states like Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina have become somewhat more competitive over the past several election cycles. But another close statewide race for O\u2019Rourke this year doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Texas is on the verge of turning blue \u2014 or even purple. That\u2019s because O\u2019Rourke is, well, O\u2019Rourke, and without a stronger campaign infrastructure throughout the state, it will be hard for most Texas Democrats running in statewide elections to replicate his level of fundraising and fanfare. And, fundamentally, Texas is still a red-leaning state. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign style is hard to emulate because, for one, he\u2019s become a buzzy celebrity candidate since his 2018 race, and he has a gift for making headlines. When he\u2019s not standing up to hecklers at campaign events or interrupting Abbott at a news conference in Uvalde, where 19 students and two teachers died in a mass shooting, O\u2019Rourke has made a name for himself by zig-zagging his Toyota Tundra across the state, snapping selfies with voters and dropping f-bombs to fire up his base.  As the chart below shows, public curiosity about O\u2019Rourke has waned since his 2020 run, according to Google Trends data, but he\u2019s still able to draw national attention.   But politicians can only get so far on personality alone \u2014 and O\u2019Rourke is no exception. That doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a strong candidate, though. A poll fielded in late August and early September by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin gave Abbott only a 5-percentage-point edge over O\u2019Rourke. And another, more recent, poll from Quinnipiac University conducted in late September gave Abbott a slightly larger, 7-point edge.  Still, it\u2019s unlikely that O\u2019Rourke will be able to build a lasting campaign infrastructure for future Texas Democrats to replicate if they want to run statewide. That\u2019s because of one major problem: an apparent lack of organization among the Democratic Party in Texas. To build on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 \u2014 and likely 2022 \u2014 margins against incumbent Republicans, the party would need to build and sustain a solid campaign infrastructure well past this year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cOne of the issues for Democrats here is that there\u2019s been a lot of turnover in their candidate pool,\u201d said James Henson, the executive director of the Texas Politics Project. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a pretty big indicator that there\u2019s not really an established, institutional foundation in the Democratic Party here in the way that you do see it on the Republican side.\u201d  In addition to issues with recruitment and turnover facing Democrats running in marquee Texas races \u2014 save for O\u2019Rourke and former oil executive Mike Collier, who is challenging Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick again after losing to him by 5 points in 2018 \u2014 the party has run inexperienced candidates against formidable Republicans and doesn\u2019t have a presence in a sizable chunk of the state. Case in point: Over 50 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties have no organized county party or leaders, according to the state Democratic Party\u2019s website. A notable number of those counties are in rural parts of the state too, and even in 2018, O\u2019Rourke won the support of only 24 percent of the voters living in Texas\u2019s 186 rural3 counties, according to The Texas Tribune. Cruz, in contrast, won over 75 percent of the vote there.  Moreover, Henson told me, there\u2019s no obvious successor who can build off \u2014 and improve upon \u2014 the infrastructure that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign has created. \u201cIn the past, there were times when successful campaigns, at least indirectly, provided people with a model for organizing and professional skills,\u201d Henson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not happening here in Texas.\u201d In 2018, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s close contest against Cruz helped Democrats Lizzie Fletcher of Houston and Colin Allred of Dallas flip two congressional districts by each unseating a long-term Republican incumbent. Democrats had a net gain of 12 seats in the Texas House as well. But then, in 2020, Texas Democrats fell short of their electoral goals. There are other reasons, though, why a close win for O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to Democrats\u2019 political future in Texas. For one, the Republican Party\u2019s brand is still strong in Texas. When it comes to key policy issues, polling suggests that voters still overwhelmingly trust Republicans over Democrats. The August-September Texas Politics Project survey, for example, showed that voters were more likely to trust Abbott over O\u2019Rourke on handling issues like the U.S.-Mexico border situation and the economy. Voters trusted O\u2019Rourke more on abortion, however.  Yet while voters were divided over who could better handle gun violence, Texans said the top issues facing the state were border security, immigration, political corruption/leadership and inflation/rising prices \u2014 abortion and gun control/gun violence were further down their list. That means that any Democrat running after O\u2019Rourke would need to win voters\u2019 trust on these issues \u2014 and that\u2019s a tall order given that even O\u2019Rourke has had only limited success.  On top of that, demographic changes in Texas that at one point may have been viewed as good news for Democrats might not end up working in their favor. The state\u2019s Hispanic population is growing, but demographics are not destiny in American politics \u2014 and those voters might be a hard bloc for Democrats to make further gains with, especially after Texas\u2019s border counties moved sharply to the right in 2020. Voters in other rural parts of the state have also been hard for Democrats to win, and despite O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaigning in rural counties, it\u2019s not clear whether even he is making significant inroads. And so far, O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t necessarily provided a foolproof model for winning over Republican and independent voters, whose support he\u2019d need to beat Abbott in what is still a red-leaning state. O\u2019Rourke might be a major presence in Texas, but he\u2019s not actually that popular. A September poll from the University of Texas at Tyler for The Dallas Morning News, for instance, found that almost half of the state\u2019s registered voters \u2014 47 percent \u2014 had a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of O\u2019Rourke compared with 40 percent who viewed him in a positive light. He didn\u2019t fare well with independent voters, either: 46 percent had an unfavorable view of O\u2019Rourke versus 34 percent who had a favorable opinion.  The survey didn\u2019t ask respondents to assess Abbott\u2019s favorability, but exactly half of voters said they strongly or somewhat approved of his job performance as governor; meanwhile, 47 percent said they disapproved. Those numbers have given O\u2019Rourke\u2019s opponents an opportunity, too. Since his presidential campaign, he has given Republicans a useful foil to inspire their own turnout. In short, for Texas Democrats to succeed statewide, they\u2019d need to have a healthy mixture of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s popularity, an appeal to a wider swath of voters and, ideally, not be a bogeyman or bogey(wo)man for Republicans. That\u2019s a big ask in a state that hasn\u2019t fielded especially strong Democratic candidates beyond O\u2019Rourke in the past few statewide election cycles.\u00a0 Of course, because the Democratic candidate is O\u2019Rourke \u2014\u00a0a micro-celebrity in the state and nationwide \u2014 the race could be close. That said, his race likely won\u2019t say much about Texas Democrats\u2019 larger ambitions to flip the state because there\u2019s still a lot of work that needs to be done before they get there.",

    "Two Election Deniers Are Facing Very Different Odds In Arizona": [
        "By Kaleigh Rogers",
        " There are election deniers, and then there\u2019s Kari Lake. While 201 Republican nominees1 have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, few have made claims of fraud as central to their campaign as Lake, the Republican nominee for Arizona governor. A darling among former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsees, Lake has repeated his unfounded claims that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and spread baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud. And she looks well-positioned to take on her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, as it\u2019s currently a toss-up with Hobbs at a 52-in-100 chance to Lake\u2019s 48-in-100, according to our midterm forecast.2 So why then, in another statewide race in this purple state, is a fellow Trump-endorsed election denier facing tougher odds? Blake Masters, the Republican nominee for Senate, has just a 17-in-100 chance of winning against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Senate forecast. Like Lake, Masters has claimed Trump \u201cwon in 2020,\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t have accepted the results if he were in office at the time.\u00a0 Of course, these races are about more than election denialism. While 2020 has cast a long shadow over many campaigns, most voters in the state are more concerned with issues like inflation and abortion than election fraud. And even when it comes to election denial, there is some daylight between Lake and Masters\u2019s positions. Still, these candidates have a lot of similarities, at least on paper, so why is one in a toss-up and the other struggling to keep up?\u00a0 Let\u2019s stress test a few theories of where these two candidates are similar \u2014 and where they differ \u2014 to see if we can unravel the mystery of Blake and Lake.\u00a0 One possible explanation is simply that Lake and Masters are squaring off against different opponents. Kelly has a couple of advantages that Hobbs doesn\u2019t. For one, Kelly is an incumbent, and a popular one \u2014 in a September survey of likely Arizona voters by AARP/Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research, the senator had a 50 percent approval rating, including a 14 percent approval rating among Republicans (as far as cross-party approval goes, that\u2019s pretty good). As a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, he has a lot of name recognition and a healthy amount of public goodwill.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Hobbs has been unavoidably at the center of the election denial issue. As secretary of state, Hobbs was responsible for administering the 2020 election and certifying the results, making her persona non grata for voters who baselessly believe that the election was fraudulent. Hobbs was also embroiled in an actual scandal last year over the prior firing of a staffer while she was in the state Senate. And Hobbs has refused to debate Lake, a move that has given her opponent plenty of fuel for attacks while preventing voters from seeing the two candidates square off head-to-head (though they will both be participating in a town hall forum next week). Combined, these factors show Hobbs as a weaker opponent than Kelly. But FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling averages suggest that\u2019s not the sole explanation for the differences in these two races. The polls show Masters struggling to keep up with Kelly, while Lake is giving Hobbs a run for her money. But if you look at total vote shares, it\u2019s clear that the biggest difference is not between Kelly and Hobbs \u2014 it\u2019s between Lake and Masters. Kelly, Hobbs and Lake are all within spitting distance of each other: Kelly has 49 percent support, Hobbs 47 percent, and Lake is right on Hobbs\u2019s tail with 46 percent. But Masters is the odd one out with only 42 percent support, showing that in these races, the biggest gulf is between the GOP candidates, not their opponents.  If their respective opponents aren\u2019t to blame for the discrepancy between Lake and Masters, maybe their bank accounts are. While never a guarantee of a win, a well-funded campaign can sometimes explain the difference in a close race. In the governor\u2019s race, the most recent state election filings show Lake has brought in $3.8 million and spent $3.6 million, while Hobbs has outraised her only marginally, bringing in $4.4 million and spending $3.9 million. In the Senate race, Masters has raised just over $5 million. But Kelly. Oh, Kelly. He has one of the highest-funded election campaigns in the country, having raised over $54 million as of July, spending over $30 million, so it\u2019s almost certainly even higher as we head into the midterms.\u00a0 So it certainly seems like we found our outlier, but as I mentioned above, the starkest differences in the polls are between support for the GOP nominees, not the Democrats. Kelly\u2019s flush coffers have likely helped him tamp down his opponent more effectively than Hobbs, but it also doesn\u2019t explain the whole story.\u00a0 Let\u2019s return to the assumptions at the top that Lake and Masters are, at least on paper, very similar candidates. While it\u2019s true that they both have repeated lies about the 2020 election and have been endorsed by Trump, they differ in a couple of crucial ways.  First is that Masters has backtracked from the 2020 election issue, scrubbing language from his website claiming that Trump would have won \u201cif we had had a free and fair election.\u201d At first glance, this dovier posture would seem to play to Masters\u2019s benefit. After all, Biden did win Arizona in 2020 \u2014 albeit by less than 1 percentage point \u2014 and moderate candidates tend to perform better than more extreme ones. While we don\u2019t know that Masters has suffered uniquely by taking this stance, we do know that GOP voters in Arizona aren\u2019t exactly disqualifying candidates who take an extreme stance. For example, in the race for Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, Republican candidate Mark Finchem has remained an extreme election denier (including spending most of a recent debate regurgitating baseless conspiracy theories) and yet led in a recent poll (though, notably, a full quarter of voters in that poll were undecided).  And Lake has actually been the less extreme candidate between the two when it comes to an issue more important to voters: abortion. Masters spent the primary advocating for a national \u201cpersonhood law,\u201d which typically means a full ban on abortions nationwide, and has supported a federal 15-week abortion ban bill introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham. Since winning the primary, Masters has removed the \u201cpersonhood\u201d language from his website and said he supports a federal ban on third trimester abortions. Lake says she is pro-life, but her abortion platform focuses on support for people who are pregnant and access to birth control, not addressing abortion bans. When asked directly about bans, Lake has dodged the question. Toss in the fact that, after two decades on local TV as a newscaster, Lake enjoys a generous dollop of name recognition, and the puzzle pieces start to come together.\u00a0 We can also see something like this reflected in that AARP poll: Among Republicans, Lake is extremely popular, attracting 88 percent of likely GOP voters (Hobbs similarly has 94 percent support from Democrats), but Masters lags behind, drawing just 80 percent of likely Republican voters. Republican likely voters view Lake more favorably, too, at 80 percent favorability compared to Masters\u2019s 71 percent.\u00a0 Whichever way you slice it, Masters is coming up short where Lake is prevailing, and it\u2019s clear her more extreme election stances haven\u2019t stopped her from strongly contending against her Democratic opponent. While candidates like Masters are easing away from the Trumpiest rhetoric after securing their nomination, Lake may yet prove that you can still win while embracing an extreme position.  CLARIFICATION (Sept. 30, 2022, 2:36 p.m.): This story has been updated to clarify that Katie Hobbs has a 52-in-100 chance of winning the Arizona governor\u2019s race and Kari Lake has a 48-in-100 chance, not that they are projected to win 52 percent and 48 percent of the vote, respectively.",

    "Do Democrats And Republicans Agree On Anything About Climate Change And Immigration?": [
        "By Holly Fuong and Geoffrey Skelley",
        " The last few weeks have been tumultuous for the issues of climate change and immigration. Record-setting summer temperatures, historic floods and devastating hurricanes have raised the stakes for the climate-change provisions contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, Republican governors in Florida and Texas have attracted media attention for paying to transport migrants and asylum seekers to liberal areas of the country.  These two issues aren\u2019t obviously linked, but they have one major commonality: They rank among the most partisan in the United States. Those on the left care a great deal about climate change, while those on the right are more likely to identify immigration and border security as an important issue. In light of recent developments in both these areas, we decided to focus the fifth wave of our FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll on climate change and immigration. Using Ipsos\u2019s KnowledgePanel, we\u2019ve been asking the same group of about 2,000 Americans what they feel are the country\u2019s most important issues. In our latest poll, \u201cinflation or increasing costs,\u201d \u201ccrime or gun violence\u201d and \u201cpolitical extremism or polarization\u201d continued to appear on Americans\u2019 list of most important issues, as they\u2019ve ranked among the top three in each wave of our survey since we began polling in late April. But climate change (20 percent) and immigration (19 percent) were next in our most recent wave, as the chart below shows.1\u00a0 Few issues had a wider partisan split than climate change or immigration. Overall, 36 percent of Democrats and just 5 percent of Republicans ranked climate change as a top issue facing the country. Conversely, 38 percent of Republicans and 6 percent of Democrats cited immigration as a top concern. This split has appeared consistently across all five waves: In each, 21 percent to 36 percent of Democrats have named climate change as a top issue, and 32 percent to 38 percent of Republicans have said the same of immigration.  When it comes to climate change, Americans are divided by party on more than simply its importance. When asked how much of climate change is caused by humans, 88 percent of Democrats and just 35 percent of Republicans said that it was \u201centirely\u201d or \u201cmostly\u201d caused by humans, with independents between the two at 65 percent.2 When asked whether the U.S. should pass regulations related to climate change that were \u201cmore strict,\u201d \u201cless strict\u201d or \u201cabout as strict as they are today,\u201d 76 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of independents and only 17 percent of Republicans wanted stricter regulations.3\u00a0 And when asked to choose between two approaches to dealing with climate change, 89 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents supported prioritizing changes today that would reduce the effects of climate change before they happen, while 57 percent of Republicans preferred adjusting to climate change as it\u2019s happening to minimize disruptions to daily life. Willie Yelverton, a 50-year-old Black man from Pennsylvania who identified as a Democrat, told us that even seemingly mundane changes would be important to reducing the impact of climate change. \u201c[The government will] need to institute standard issue tax breaks for reusable materials,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll have to be bans on goods that don\u2019t have a path to be recycled and or reused going forward. Those are small line items, but it\u2019s a very tough pill to swallow.\u201d However, we did find more agreement across party lines when it came to legislative action to address climate change. We asked Americans whether they supported three climate-change measures included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which became law last month (we asked this without referring to the Inflation Reduction Act by name). As the chart below indicates, Americans across the political spectrum were at least somewhat receptive to them.4   Overall, more than 60 percent backed each of the three proposals, which included an increased emphasis on developing and using alternative energy sources, increased government regulation on corporations\u2019 carbon emissions and giving tax credits to corporations that reduce carbon emissions. This included a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents, too, save for increasing government regulation of business\u2019 carbon emissions \u2014 although a plurality of Republicans still backed this idea (47 percent). Despite decently strong support for these proposals, Americans were largely unfamiliar with the Inflation Reduction Act, with only 38 percent stating that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d familiar with it.5 We also found that, regardless of party, a respondent\u2019s concern about climate change related to whether he or she had experienced unusual climate events. Republicans displayed a striking worry gap based on experience: Forty-six percent of those who had encountered extreme weather in the past five years said they were worried about climate change, compared with just 17 percent who hadn\u2019t (a gap 8 percentage points larger than the one seen among Democrats, who already had a majority of respondents express worry about climate change independent of their experiences).6 A 61-year-old man from Florida who identified as a person of color and a Republican said he had recently experienced an extreme weather event, noting particular concern over \u201cthe obvious destruction of natural resources due to excessive heat, diminished water reserves and unusual number of heat domes impacting climate across multiple continents.\u201d  With the media spotlight hovering over immigration, partisan divides toward immigration should also come as little surprise. When we asked if rules surrounding legal immigration should become \u201cmore strict,\u201d \u201cless strict\u201d or \u201cremain about the same,\u201d a plurality of Republicans (43 percent) preferred stricter rules, while 36 percent preferred the status quo, and 12 percent backed looser regulations (the remainder didn\u2019t know or skipped the question). By comparison, only 11 percent of Democrats favored more restrictive rules, with 73 percent split evenly between wanting things to remain about the same or become less strict.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Republicans were more unified on the issue of illegal immigration, as 78 percent said they wanted stricter rules toward those entering the country without proper authorization, compared to just 24 percent of Democrats who said the same. Michael Ritchie, a 27-year-old white man from Texas who identified as a conservative-libertarian independent, told us he wanted the government to incentivize legal immigration and disincentivize immigrants entering the country without legal permission. \u201cI don't think there can ever be enough boots on the ground, per se, to completely secure the border,\u201d he said. \u201cBut creating new policies or revamping immigration policies that would keep people from coming here simply for free rides or anything like that, but also make it easier for people to come here legally.\u201d That aligns with another finding in our poll: Among the 1 in 5 respondents who named immigration as a top issue facing the country, 95 percent said undocumented immigration was a bigger issue for the country, compared with just 1 percent who said legal immigration. \u201cThe federal government abandoned its duty to protect our borders. The flow of immigration outside the proper process is a symptom that anything can cross it without control,\u201d said a 41-year-old Hispanic man from New York who identified as Republican. And unlike the policy ideas to tackle climate change, Americans were more split on the best ways to address immigration concerns. When we asked whether respondents supported or opposed five immigration-related proposals, the only one that received majority support was the U.S. accepting more refugees from Ukraine.  But as we\u2019ve seen in other polls, Americans view refugees differently based on where they\u2019re from, as only 45 percent overall wanted to accept more refugees from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Republicans were far and away most supportive of expanding the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico (80 percent) and further restricting the number of visas given out (62 percent), while solid majorities of Democrats opposed these ideas (75 percent and 60 percent, respectively). Outside of supporting an increase in Ukrainian refugees and opposing the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Canada, independents were split pretty evenly on these proposals.\u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s not as if these issues stand apart from each other. A 24-year-old multiracial woman from California who identified as a Democrat said, \u201c[Climate change] will have such a large impact on America\u2019s future, yet it\u2019s turned into a \u2018political issue\u2019 with so much disinformation being spread. People are refusing to make the changes necessary to reverse climate change because of politicians who tell them lies.\u201d Others tied immigration to issues such as health care. \u201cIllegal immigration is a burden on the health care, judicial, education, etc. systems in the U.S. Even legal immigration hurts the U.S. with overpopulation,\u201d said a 63-year-old white man from New York who identified as a Republican.  And how these issues motivate or persuade voters to back one party or the other will be of vital importance when voters go to the polls in November. With fewer than six weeks until the midterms, 46 percent of respondents told us they were certain or almost certain to vote, up from 42 percent back in the first wave in the spring. And among those likely voters, Democrats and Republicans are about evenly split on the generic ballot, with 41 percent saying that they plan to vote for a Democrat and 40 percent planning to vote for a Republican (which is within the margin of error). Still, 17 percent of likely voters told us they intended to vote for a third-party option or didn't know how they planned to vote. Based on their highly partisan nature in today\u2019s political environment, climate change and immigration may not immediately jump out as issues that help undecided voters make up their minds. But we\u2019ll get a firmer answer to this question next month, when we take a closer look at which issues voters are thinking about the most when they cast their ballots.\u00a0 Art direction by Dan Dao.

    "Women Have Swung Toward Democrats Since The Dobbs Decision": [
        "By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Meredith Conroy",
        " With about a month before the midterm election, some Republican candidates across the country are scrambling to moderate their position on abortion. Supporting the recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion \u2014 might be a winner in a Republican primary, but early signs are that it makes it harder to win a general election. The conventional wisdom is that that\u2019s in part because women are more motivated to vote this election season thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Conventional wisdom isn\u2019t necessarily based on evidence, though. And while abortion is an increasingly important issue for women, there are signs it is galvanizing some men too. If the Dobbs decision were motivating more women than men, then there\u2019s a metric where that change would probably show up: the gender gap. The gender gap is calculated by looking at the difference between the share of men and women who voted for a particular candidate or party. A higher share of women than men have voted for Democrats in every midterm election since 1980, and in the past two midterm cycles the gap has been even bigger.  The 2018 midterm elections are a good example. That year, according to the exit polls, 59 percent of women \u2014 and only 47 percent of men \u2014 voted Democratic, which means the gender gap was historically wide, at nearly 12 percentage points. It will be hard to exceed that gap, even with abortion at the forefront of many voters\u2019 minds. Our analysis of polls conducted between June and September suggests that, yes, women are leaning heavily toward Democrats, while men are more likely to support Republicans. But in our polling average,1 the gender gap isn\u2019t quite as big as it was at this point in 2018.  Of course, the size of the gender gap will vary depending on the poll. We looked at two Pew Research Center polls \u2014 one conducted in August 2018 and one in August 2022 \u2014 and found that, in contrast with our average, the gender gap for Democrats among registered voters was a little wider in 2022 (6 points) than it was at the same point in 2018 (5 points), although it\u2019s in the same ballpark. And it is noteworthy that Pew\u2019s data says the 2022 gender gap is looking similar to the gap at the same point in 2018, given that Democrats have more electoral headwinds this year. \u201cI expect that the [Supreme Court] ruling will lead women \u2014 especially Gen-Z women \u2014 to be far more engaged with the midterms than they would have been otherwise,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit polling organization.\u00a0 But the gender gap is a measure of one fairly specific thing: how women vote relative to men. And that can be complicated when it comes to abortion, because men and women overall have very similar views on the issue. As we\u2019ve written before, whether someone supports or opposes abortion rights has much more to do with their view of gender roles than their own gender. It\u2019s possible, for example, that if left-leaning men are also unusually motivated to turn out, the gender gap could be smaller. A similar dynamic happened in 2020, when men moved toward President Joe Biden, resulting in a smaller gender gap compared with 2016.\u00a0 So far, the evidence about how men are responding to the Dobbs ruling is mixed. Over the past few months, polls have found over and over again that rising concern over abortion is most dramatic among women, and reports of surging voter registration have focused on women. Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University-Camden, said this makes sense because women \u2014 in particular, reproductive-aged women who support legal abortion \u2014 are more likely than men to feel personally threatened by the sudden loss of abortion rights. But there have also been reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among young men. An analysis of a series of polls by the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem,2 shared with FiveThirtyEight, before and after the Dobbs ruling found that men of reproductive age were more likely to prioritize \u201csafe and legal abortion\u201d as a voting issue. In our polling average,3 we found that the gender gap for both Democrats and Republicans grew from June through September, but the gap grew more for Republicans than for Democrats. The two gaps are lopsided because men\u2019s share of support for Democrats has grown as well as women\u2019s, which means that the full magnitude of the shift doesn\u2019t show up in that party\u2019s side. Meanwhile, the shift in the Republicans\u2019 gender gap shows something different: While the share of men supporting Republicans hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully since June, the share of women supporting Republicans has declined, causing the gap to increase. Daniel Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said that abortion-rights opponents might also be fired up by the Dobbs decision \u2014 but that\u2019s less likely to show up as a change in the polls because those people are a solid part of the Republican base and more likely to vote in midterm elections to begin with. \u201cThis year, motivating those [anti-abortion voters] doesn\u2019t really help Republicans, because they\u2019re already motivated,\u201d he said. He explained that reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among women and young voters are another complicating factor because it\u2019s hard for pollsters to account for unexpected surges in turnout. Young voters tend to have particularly low turnout, and pollsters sometimes rely on how demographic groups have behaved in the past when they create models to determine who\u2019s likely to vote and who isn\u2019t. If young women are unusually motivated to vote this year, that could throw off pollsters\u2019 estimates. And then there are all the other factors that influence how people vote. Inflation and the economy are other issues that still consistently show up at the top of voters\u2019 priority lists, and that\u2019s not good for Democrats. Even though the economic outlook has improved in some respects over the past few months, a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll found that only 26 percent of Americans said that Democrats would do a better job handling the economy, while 39 percent said Republicans would do a better job. (An additional 20 percent said that neither party would do a better job, and 12 percent said they\u2019d do an equally good job.)\u00a0 So the question isn\u2019t just whether abortion is motivating women more than men \u2014 it\u2019s whether concern about abortion will lead voters who might be skeptical about the Democratic Party to vote for its candidates anyway. That group includes men as well as women, and their decisions will do a lot to shape how wide or narrow the gender gap turns out to be. Mary Radcliffe and Cooper Burton contributed research.",

        " FIRST ON FOX:Several Republican lawmakers shared their concerns aboutPresident Biden\u2019s latest gaffein which he appeared to search for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., in a crowd while calling out for her. During his remarks at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health on Wednesday, Bidenappeared to search for Walorski, who died in a car accident last month. \"I want to thank all of you here, including bipartisan elected officials like \u2026 Senator Braun, Senator Booker, Representative \u2026 Jackie, Jackie are you here?\" Biden said, searching for the late congresswoman. \"I think she was going to be here to help make this a reality.\" WH PLAYS DAMAGE CONTROL YET AGAIN AFTER BIDEN SEARCH FOR DECEASED REP. WALORSKI ADDS TO LIST OF WALK-BACKS A video tribute to the late Republican congresswoman was scheduled to play at the event but was not shown while the president and White House press pool were at the event. Several Republican lawmakers spoke out with their concerns on the president\u2019s mental state, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, telling Fox News Digital that \"Joe Biden\u2019s diminished capacity is so blatantly obvious that even the White House Press corps couldn\u2019t hide their concern.\" \"That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s bad,\" Cruz added. Fellow Texas Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson, who served as physician to the president for both Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, again called for Biden to take \"a cognitive test.\" \"In yet another pathetic display of incompetence, Joe Biden not only thought my departed colleague was alive, but he also had his puppet-master, Karine Jean-Pierre, deny he was confused,\" Jackson said in a statement. \"It doesn\u2019t take a neurologist to realize he\u2019s in serious cognitive decline. The American people know what\u2019s going on here, and they don\u2019t think the Commander-in-Chief is capable of doing his job,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s past time for White House staff and the liberal media to stop shielding him from questions about his mental acuity and demand he answer my call for a cognitive test,\" the Texas Republican added. Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., a practicing surgeon and the GOP Doctors Caucus vice chairman, told Fox News Digital that these \"kinds of senseless gaffes have become par for the course for this president\" and blasted the White House for their \"cover-up\" of the gaffe. \"The American people can see that Mr. Biden\u2019s mental acuity is certainly in question,\" the North Carolina Republican said. \"What\u2019s more disturbing to me, however, is the way in which this White House continues to deceive and misdirect the American people on a daily basis.\" \"It appears there is nothing the White House won\u2019t do to cover up for a failed president and a failed administration,\" Murphy added. \"The American people clearly deserve better.\" Kyle Hupfer, the Indiana Republican Party chairman, released a statement on Wednesday after Biden's gaffe, saying it \"calls too much into question.\" \"No amount of spin from the White House can justify President Joe Biden forgetting the tragic passing of Jackie Walorski \u2014 the latest gaffe that calls so much into question,\" Hupfer said. \"The American people deserve a straight answer, not a political talking point, as to how the President of the United States could forget that a congresswoman he was purportedly trying to honor had passed away just last month,\" he continued. \"White House Spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre\u2019s explanation is a disrespectful lie to Jackie\u2019s constituents and the American people,\" Hupfer added. \"We deserve a real answer.\" When asked for comment, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital that \"President Biden has delivered record job creation, achieved the biggest infrastructure investment in 70 years, empowered Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs, signed the most far-reaching gun reform since 1994, made NATO the strongest it has ever been, and taken unprecedented action to fight climate change and bring manufacturing back from overseas.\" The president had mourned the late Walorski a month prior to Wednesday\u2019s gaffe, prompting the White House to play defense and clean up another comment. \"The President speaks directly and candidly \u2014 straight from the shoulder, as he often says,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson told Fox News Digital in a statement, when asked about the president's long track record of saying things his staffers later corrected. \"Doing so has been critical to his success in everything from rallying the world to support Ukraine to empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices,\" Patterson added. \"And when he feels the need to add context to something he said, or to direct his staff to do so \u2014 as every President has \u2014 he doesn\u2019t hesitate to.\" The White House's comments came after Jean-Pierre struggled to explain away his latest gaffe. After the bizarre episode, Jean-Pierre said Biden \"was naming the congressional champions on this issue and was acknowledging her incredible work.\" \"He had already planned to welcome the congresswoman\u2019s family to the White House on Friday \u2014 there will be a bill-signing in her honor this coming Friday,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"So, of course, she was on his mind. She was at top of mind for the president.\" Jean-Pierre doubled down on the White House\u2019s cleanup of Biden\u2019s fumble when pressed by reporters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden's mental state was also joked about by his son, Hunter, in a text exchange with his therapist from his infamous laptop. A few months before Biden launched his presidential campaign, Hunter was exchanging text messages with Keith Ablow, his therapist and friend, in early January 2019. The book highlighted that Ablow and Hunter were discussing Democratic presidential candidates when Ablow said, \"Your dad is the answer\" and then later quoted himself, mockingly saying, \"Any man who can triumph over dementia is a giant. Think what he could do for our nation's needed recovery.\" \"You're such an a--hole, but that made me laugh out loud,\" Hunter replied. Ablow went on to quote himself, saying, \"Perhaps he can help us remember all we intended to be as a people since he can now remember his address,\" prompting Hunter to say that his father \"doesn't need to [know] where he lives\" because \"that's the only thing the secret service get[s] right at least 75% of the time.\" Fox News Digital's Cameron Cawthorne and Thomas Catenacci contributed reporting.",

    "Democrats blaming climate change for Hurricane Ian at odds with science, experts say": [
        " \n        By\n        Thomas Catenacci   | Fox News ",
        " Multiple experts contacted by Fox News Digital argued that there isn't sufficient evidence to suggest climate change caused Hurricane Ian orany individual natural disaster. The experts' comments come as a series of media outlets, Democrats and progressive commentators continue to blame the hurricane on human-caused global warming.Hurricane Ian slammed into southwest Floridaas a Category 4 storm on Wednesday, causing more than a million residents to lose power and prompting stark safety warnings from Florida officials. \"What they're trying to do is politicize the pain and suffering of these people to promote their green agenda,\" Gregory Wrightstone, the executive director of the climate policy think tank CO2 Coalition, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"Well, their policies and their agenda to promote renewables will do far greater economic destruction to the country and Florida.\" Over the last several days, media outlets, including the New York Times, Associated Press, Politico, NPR and Axios, have published news stories reporting thatclimate change is to blamefor Hurricane Ian and the storm's rapid intensification. A Time magazine article said the \"science is well known\" that climate change created the conditions for Hurricane Ian. NASA: VIDEO OF HURRICANE IAN CAPTURED FROM SPACE STATION AS IT HITS FLORIDA In addition, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., appeared to suggest that Americans need to vote for Democrats to avoid future hurricanes during an interview Tuesday. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., tweeted Thursday that \"the rapid storm intensification we're seeing with Hurricane Ian will become more common and more dangerous\" as the climate changes. And a series of progressive commentators and climate activists took to social media to similarly peg the hurricane on global warming. MIDTERM CANDIDATES RUNNING RACES IN HURRICANE IAN'S PATH REACT TO THE DISASTROUS STORM \"Ian is a climate change hurricane,\" Pam Keith, a former Democratic Senate candidate and founder of left-wing firm Center for Employment Justice, tweeted Wednesday. \"[Hurricane Ian] is a textbook example of climate change impacting people,\" Nina Turner, a senior fellow at progressive think tank Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, added. \"Climate change isn\u2019t political, it\u2019s reality.\" However, Wrightstone and the other experts contacted by Fox News Digital rejected those arguments, arguing that individual storms cannot be linked to climate change. \"If you read what [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)] says on hurricanes, there's just not enough data,\" Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"There's nothing to back up what they're saying is,\" he continued. \"There were about 16 major hurricanes between 1916 and 1965 but only six since 1965. So, clearly major hurricanes happen with lower levels of carbon dioxide. That doesn't add up for them.\" BIDEN SUGGESTS AMERICANS NOT PROUD OF US IN DIVISIVE FUNDRAISER SPEECH AS FLORIDA PUMMELED BY HURRICANE IAN A NOAAstudylast revised in July concluded that its models and analysis didn't support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic. The study, authored by senior NOAA scientist Tom Knutson, added that it was \"premature to conclude with high confidence\" that human-caused increasing greenhouse gases have had any impact on hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Jamie Rhome, the acting director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, echoed the study's findings in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, pushing back against anchor Don Lemon's argument that Hurricane Ian's intensification is tied to climate change. Rhome said he \"would caution against\" linking any one storm to climate change. \"Trying to blame global warming for Hurricane Ian not only defies scientific evidence \u2014 the clear weight of scientific evidence \u2014 but it is a despicable politicization of a real tragedy that requires our attention and focus on the people negatively affected,\" James Taylor, the president of conservative think tank\u202fHeartland\u202fInstitute, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"These types of hurricanes existed before SUVs and coal-fired power plants were invented,\" Taylor added. \"In fact, they were much more frequent and severe before coal power plants and SUVs.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Wrightstone, who also serves as an expert reviewer for the United Nations'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), added that the number of hurricanes this year has actually been lower than previous years. \"The IPCC sees no correlation between warming temperatures and more hurricanes,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"And we saw that this year. Up until this hurricane, which is massive, it had been almost historically low numbers of hurricanes.\"",

Cannon on Thursday overruled an order by Special Master Raymond Dearie that said former President Donald Trump needed to provide any\"final\" objectionsor disputes regarding the items seized by the FBI during its unprecedented raid on Mar-a-Lago last month. Last week, Dearie asked the Trump team that by no later than Sept. 30 to provide a declaration of affidavit that includes a list of any specific items in the property inventory that theyassert were not seizedfrom the premises; a list of items that were seized but to which the description of the contents or the location of the item was incorrect; and a list and description of any item that Trump\u2019s legal team asserts was seized but is not listed in the property receipt. \"This submission shall be plaintiff\u2019s final opportunity to raise any factual dispute as to the completeness and accuracy of the Detailed property inventory,\" Dearie wrote in the filing last week. SPECIAL MASTER TAPS RETIRED JUDGE WITH \u2018TOP SECRET\u2019 CLEARANCE TO AID IN REVIEW OF SEIZED MAR-A-LAGO RECORDS Cannon, who appointed Dearie as special master, reviewed his order and on Thursday said there \"shall be no separate requirement\" for Trump \"at this stage, prior to the review of the Seized Materials, to lodge ex ante final objections to the accuracy of Defendant\u2019s Inventory, its descriptions, or its contents.\" \"The Court\u2019s Appointment Order did not contemplate that obligation; Defendant since has complied with the requirement to attest to its now-revised inventory and the parties and the Special Master are situated to proceed forward with the process pending exchange of the actual materials,\" Cannon wrote.

The special master is tasked with reviewing approximately 11,000 records seized by the FBI during its unprecedented raid of Trump\u2019s private residence. The special master and his team will review those records for executive privilege, attorney-client privilege and for personal records. The Justice Department\u2019s motion was accepted by the 11th Circuit Court last week, which allows the government to continue its review of the approximately 100 classified documents seized during the raid on Aug. 8. Dearie, in his filing last week, announced that he has \"determined that the efficient administration of the Special Master\u2019s duties requires the assistance of the Honorable James Orenstein (Ret.), a former United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of New York, who has experience with complex case management, privilege review, warrant procedures, and other matters that may arise in the course of the Special Master\u2019s duties.\" Dearie said that Orenstein has served as \"an appointed amicus curiae in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\" and \"currently holds Top Secret clearance.\" Dearie, who also served on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, signed off on a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign aide Carter Page \u2014 before the FBI misconduct surrounding that application was discovered. In the filing Thursday, the special master said he will utilize the Eastern District of New York court staff in carrying out his duties. He also noted that he will \"seek no additional compensation for performing the duties of Special Master in this action,\" but he proposed that Orenstein \"be compensated at the hourly rate of $500.\" Cannon, in her order, said neither party objected to Orenstein's involvement and said the court has approved it.

        " A youngTennessee entrepreneuris making a major difference in his community and the environment through his cardboard box business. Twenty-one-year-old Ashton Gilbert, who has autism, started his owncardboard recycling business,UnBoxed, amid the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with Fox News Digital, both Gilbert and his mom, Ashley York, explained that they realized there was a whole lot of cardboard to be picked up around the neighborhood as online shopping became a necessity \u2014 and not just a nice thing to do \u2014 beginning in early 2020. BOSTON TAVERN MANAGER SHARES WORK ETHIC AND COMMUNITY TIES WITH A NEW GENERATION OF STAFF Since Gilbert\u2019s employment and activity services were on hold, York said her son \"really needed something to do\" with his time. \"I have a small business and I was always yelling at my husband about taking my cardboard boxes to recycling,\" said York. \"And he was like, \u2018Hey, this is something Ashton could do.\u2019\" \"We thought it\u2019d be a pretty simple little job for him to do, but it\u2019s a little bit bigger than that now.\" THIS LABOR DAY, A GRATEFUL NOD TO THE LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS THAT KEEP AMERICA MOVING Gilbert officially founded UnBoxed in March 2021.

The small business owner said that although launching his business has been \"a little stressful at times,\" it\u2019s also felt \"pretty good.\" What Gilbert loves most about the job is \"interacting with customers,\" he said, plus helping the environment and giving back to his community.

Gilbert described that itfeels \"pretty good\"to be independent. Their community has been \"outstanding,\" said York, and neighbors have \"cheered Ashton on and supported him.\" \"Those who don\u2019t need his service help get word out about his service,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve even had companies donate routing systems to help me make the most sense out of how to get from location to location.\" \"It\u2019s been really supportive and I\u2019m really proud of our community for that.\" Gilbert\u2019s parents currently drive their son through his routes using a \"really old van\" without any air conditioning, which makes for tiring work on hot Tennessee days.

    "Feeding America teams up with others to help the hungry, preserve their 'dignity' and change policy": [
        " \n        By\n        Maureen Mackey   | Fox News ",
        " New York City \u2013Feeding America is the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization \u2014 and this past Friday, at an event it hosted at the Urban Outreach Center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan alongside other major hunger-relief groups, the organization took pains to stress that food insecurity in the U.S. has not eased as the nation heads into the fall of 2022 in a post-pandemic world. Rather, food insecurity is even more of a problem now in America amidcontinuing inflation and high prices, the groups made clear. \"Some of our food banks are in fact seeing higher rates, higher demand today than they did at the peak of COVID,\" Feeding America's CEO, Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, told Fox News Digital at the event. FOOD BANKS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT FALL, WINTER \u2014 SOME FAMILIES MAY NOT HAVE TURKEYS THIS YEAR City Harvest and Food Bank forNew York Cityco-hosted the event on Hunger Action Day, Sept. 23, 2022. The groups announced a joint initiative called \"Elevating Voices to End Hunger Together\" and will be taking their messages to the White House in the week ahead. As part of the effort, the groups said they collected the insights and input of nearly 36,000 people who are facing food insecurity across the U.S. in order to help drive policy changes to end hunger in America. In remarks delivered during the Friday media event, Babineaux-Fontenot stressed the importance of \"open[ing] our hearts\" and showing \"empathy\" to those who face hunger in this country. She also stressed treating those who need help with dignity \u2014 which is what the food-insecure said they want. Not only do the hungry in America need access to healthy foods \u2014 they want to maintain a sense of dignity and self-worth amid their difficulties, she said. That's whether their food insecurity is short term or long term. Babineaux-Fontenot emphasized that the lines at food pantries are not \"going away in New York \u2014 [and] they're not going away across the country,\" she said. During thefirst year of COVIDalone, some 60 million people were food insecure in America and sought help from the charitable food system, she said. Today, due to inflation, these charitable food organizations are seeing people on the lines they never saw earlier. And yet, she said, even amid great need, it sometimes feels \"as if people are leaving the field and the game's not over,\" she said. \"We must stay on the field,\" she said, referring to the efforts to provide urgent and continuing help to those who do not have enough to eat in America. \"We must not divert our attention to something else,\" she said, \"when we haven't finished this work. There is work left to be done.\" Leslie Gordon, CEO of Food Bank for New York City, one of the nation's largest food banks, also told Fox News Digital on Friday, \"The need [for help in gaining access to food] was really stubbornly high before the pandemic.\" While the perception may exist among the public that it's mostly the homeless who seek help in finding adequate food, she said the reality is quite different. Today, she said, there \"are moms and dads, hardworking people who have two jobs and are trying to make ends meet\" who are seeking help in meeting their food needs \u2014 \"and New York City happens to be a fairly expensive environment in which to live.\" FOOD BANKS IN AMERICA EXPERIENCE SURGING DEMAND: \u2018NO SIGN OF IT SLOWING DOWN ANY TIME SOON\u2019 Said Gordon, \"Let's say you're a single parent and you have two kids. You've got to make between $80,000 and $100,000 every year just to make ends meet.\" \"And there is a fair portion of the population who make considerably less than that,\" she said. As a result, \"they're faced with making some tough choices along the way,\" she said. There are senior citizens, she said, who every month must decide: \"Do I go to the pharmacy this month andpick up my medication\u2014 or do I eat?\" She said people who are forced into making such dramatic and difficult choices often make poor food choices because they cannot afford to eatthe healthier foods, which are usually more expensive. In terms of those needing help, Gordon said that pre-pandemic, the groups saw a mix of people, including seniors on limited incomes and those with low-paying jobs. But now, particularly \"since the pandemic, people have lost their jobs, particularly in the food service sector,\" she said. Also, some employers who previously had offeredfull-time jobshave changed those jobs into part-time employment \u2014 \"and it's harder for people to put together the equivalent of full-time pay\" in those scenarios, she said. Also present at the event on Friday was chef and bestselling author Rocco DeSpirito, who is a member of Feeding America's entertainment council. \"Our neighbors are hungry and we have to help,\" he said, as the Feeding America website notes. As part of the new initiative, the groups are stressing to Congress that it \"should ensure Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit amounts are sufficient to allow our neighbors in need to keep adequate amounts of nutritious food on the table.\" The groups also want to increase access to healthy foods, including for those Americans who have difficulty getting to food pantries or food sources because of distance and a lack of adequate transportation. In addition, they include the goals of expanding opportunity and improving health as part of their missions. WHY AMERICA'S MOTTO CAN BE YOUR FAMILY'S MOTTO THIS SCHOOL YEAR, ONE MOM REVEALS Feeding America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the U.S., includes a network ofmore than 200 food banks, 21 statewide food bank associations and over 60,000 partner agencies, food pantries and meal programs.

Unlike the House Republicans who unveiled theirCommitment to Americaagenda this week,\u00a0several Democrats told Fox News Digital they are content to run on their record. \"House Democrats are running on a vision of pulling people over politics,\" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. \"We're going to fight for lower costs, better jobs, and safer communities. We've been doing the work.\" \"I would say run on our record of reducing drug prices, especially for senior citizens,\" said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. \"These are real things that benefit people that we can run on.\" BIDEN\u2019S MAGA-BASHING IS TURNING OFF CENTRIST HOUSE REPUBLICANS Other Democrats, like Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, cited the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill as another major accomplishments that is popular with voters. \"We've got a record to talk about,\" said Dingell, who serves in the House leadership as co-chair of the Democrats' policy and communications committee. \"That we voted to get an infrastructure bill, fix our roads and bridges and our broadband and [to] get led out of [water] pipes.\" Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline said he and fellow Democrats were touting Biden's coronavirus relief efforts, the investments in semiconductor manufacturing, and gun control on the stump.

Republicans said they would work to roll back key components of the White House agenda if they take back the House, and would launch several oversight efforts into the administration. \"Our very first bill will repeal the 87,000 IRS agents because your government should be here to help you not to go after you,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"That's a difference with a new majority.\" House Democrats dismiss the GOP agenda as full of slogans and promises and light on substance. They insist the Democratic majorities in Congress have delivered real victories for the American people, and that voters want to get something done more than anything else. \"Anyone can make a promise or give a slogan,\" said Green. \"When there was a pandemic, and you were about to be evicted, we kept you in your home. When you needed food on your table, food was there because we helped you to get it \u2026 Democrats have been there.\" Apart from touting what they've done, House Democrats are doubling down on Biden's rhetoric portraying Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump as extremists and a threat to democracy. \"This is a Republican Party of QAnon, and chaos \u2026 the insurrection and the Big Lie,\" said Cicilline. \"It's an ultra MAGA, Trumpist party \u2026 and I think the Democrats have shown we're delivering for people, for working families and that's why we're going to hold the House.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It remains to be seen whether the strategy will succeed.

The embattled Democrat opted tovote by proxy, the process in which a member of Congress can have another member vote on legislation in their absence, choosing Rep.

A number of other members alsoopted to vote by proxy, but it wasn't immediately clear if they were also attending events.

No. Every day on my calendar is October 6, November 6, December 6. The rent is due, the car payment is due, the tuition payment is due, the mortgage payment is due and I can't do it. People are white-knuckled and worried about paying their utility bills, their insurance bills. The gas and grocery conversation is an important one, but it's a six-month-old example. Now people are looking at this winter with great trepidation,\" Conway said, adding that one of the fastest-growing groups becoming newly homeless are single mothers who have a job. \"Let that sink in. \u2026 This is the most straightforward, uncomplicated issue set going into a midterm election I've ever seen. I've been doing this for decades. It's very straightforward.

        " \n        By\n        Adam Shaw   | Fox News ",
        " FIRST ON FOX: Legislation introduced Friday by Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., would expand theDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019spowers to conduct counter-narcotic operations against cartels pushing fentanyl across the U.S. southern border as the country remains racked by an opioid crisis. The Homeland Security Fentanyl Enforcement Act would amend the Controlled Substance Act to provide DHS\u2019 Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents with an independent authority to enforce U.S. drug laws. While HSI, which is part of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has primary responsibility for investigating transnational crimes, its agents are required to rely on the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) when it comes to drug crimes. The billwould therefore give full authority for enforcement under Title 21, allowing HSI to investigate drug crimes, including the smuggling of fentanyl across the U.S.southern border. BIPARTISAN COALITION OF STATE AGS URGE BIDEN TO DECLARE FENTANYL A WMD AS OPIOID CRISIS RAGES The U.S. is dealing with an increase in deaths attributable to illicit fentanyl, which is primarily made in Mexico with Chinese precursors and then smuggled in across the southern land border via drug cartels. \u00a0The synthetic opioid is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and is frequently added to other drugs, meaning that users may often be unaware that they are ingesting it. Of the more than 108,000 overdose deaths last year, more than 80,000 were linked with fentanyl, officials say. The Drug Enforcement Administrationhas previously warnedthat the drug is killing Americans at an \"unprecedented rate. \"The criminal cartels are sending fentanyl and other deadly drugs across our border at unprecedented rates. HSI is on the frontline in the fight against the cartels, but they lack the independent statutory authority to enforce drug crimes and target narco-trafficking. It\u2019s absurd,\" Higgins said in a statement. \"We should not allow bureaucracy to constrain our efforts to combat the criminal cartels, which is why I\u2019m introducing our bill to grant HSI agents full Title 21 authority. Our legislation would add thousands of highly skilled federal law enforcement officers to fight drug trafficking \u2026 at no cost to the American taxpayers. This is a common-sense bill that helps secure America and keeps deadly drugs out of our communities.\" WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS TO TACKLE \u2018OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC\u2019 Co-sponsors on the bill include Reps. Brian Babin, R-Texas, Mike Carey, R-Ohio, Mayra Flores, R-Texas, Mary Miller, R-Ill., Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, and Chris Smith, R-N.J. Higgins\u2019 office said the bill was developed in consultation with frontline law enforcement at DHS, and noted that it would not cost the taxpayer anything as it would simply expand existing authorities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bill is the latest by lawmakers and officials to crack down on the fentanyl crisis. Earlier this month, a bipartisan coalition of 18 state attorneys general called on President Biden to take \"immediate and decisive action\" todeclare fentanyla weapon of mass destruction. Meanwhile, the White House has been highlighting its own efforts toreduce fentanyl deathsin the U.S. and has said that the 200% increase in seizures at the southern border in July is a sign that its anti-smuggling efforts are working.",

Jason Carter, the former president's grandson now leading the Carter Center board, described his grandfather, an outspoken Christian, as content with his life and legacy. \"He is looking at his 98th birthday with faith in God\u2019s plan for him,\" the younger Carter, 47, said, \"and that\u2019s just a beautiful blessing for all of us to know, personally, that he is at peace and happy with where he has been and where he\u2019s going.\" BILL MAHER SUGGESTS BIDEN BUMP KAMALA HARRIS FROM DEM TICKET IN 2024: \u2018I JUST THINK SHE\u2019S A BAD POLITICIAN' Carter Center leaders said the former president, who survived a cancer diagnosis in 2015 and a serious fall at home in 2019, already has enjoyed reading congratulatory messages sent by well-wishers around the world via social media and the center's website. But Jason Carter said his grandfather is mostly looking forward to a simple day that includes watching his favorite Major League Baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, on television. \"He\u2019s still 100% with it, even though daily life things are a lot harder now,\" Jason Carter said. \"But one thing I guarantee. He will watch all the Braves games this weekend.\" James Earl Carter Jr. won the 1976 presidential election after beginning the campaign as a little-knownone-term Georgia governor. His surprise performance in the Iowa caucuses established the small, Midwestern state as an epicenter of presidential politics. Carter went on to defeat President Gerald Ford in the general election, largely on the strength of sweeping the South before his native region shifted heavily to Republicans. A Naval Academy alumnus, Navy officer and peanut farmer, Carter won in no small part because of his promise never to lie to an electorate weary over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that resulted in Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation from the presidency in 1974. Four years later, unable to tame inflation and salve voter anger over American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost 44 states to Ronald Reagan. He returned home to Georgia in 1981 at the age of 56. TRUMP ADVISERS LAUNCH NEW SUPER PAC MAGA INC. TO SPEND MILLIONS IN MIDTERM BACKING ENDORSED CANDIDATES The former first couple almost immediately began planning The Carter Center. It opened in Atlanta in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind effort for a former president. The stated mission: to advance peace, human rights and public health causes around the world. Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled internationally into his 80s and 90s, and he did not retire officially from the board until 2020. Since opening, the center has monitored elections in 113 countries, said CEO Paige Alexander, and Carter has acted individually as a mediator in many countries, as well. Carter Center efforts have nearly eradicated the guinea worm, a parasite spread through unclean drinking water and painful to humans. Rosalynn Carter has steered programs designed to reduce stigma attached to mental health conditions. \"He\u2019s enjoying his retirement,\" said Alexander, who assumed her role in 2020, about the time Jason Carter took over for his grandfather. But \"he spends a lot of time thinking about the projects that he started and the projects that we\u2019re continuing.\" Alexander cited the guinea worm eradication effort as a highlight. Carter set the goal in 1986, when there were about 3.5 million cases annually across 21 countries, with a concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. So far this year, Alexander said, there are six known cases in two countries. JOSH BARRO SLAMS GAVIN NEWSOM AS \u2018GROSS AND EMBARRASSING,\u2019 SAYS \u2018SLEAZY\u2019 GOVERNOR WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT In 2019, Carter used his final annual message at the center to lament that his post-presidency had been largely silent on climate change. Jason Carter said the center's leadership is still exploring ways to combat the climate crisis. But he offered no timetable. \"We won't duplicate other effective efforts,\" Carter said, explaining that one of the center's strategic principles is to prioritize causes and places that no other advocacy organizations have engaged. On elections and democracy, perhaps the most unpredictable turn is that Jimmy Carter has lived to see the center turn its efforts to the home front. The center now has programs to combat mistrust in the democratic process in the United States. Carter Center personnel monitored Georgia's recount of U.S. presidential ballots in the state in 2020 after then-President Donald Trump argued the outcome was rigged.Multiple recounts in Georgiaand other states affirmed the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \"Certainly, we never thought we would end up coming home to do democracy and conflict resolution around our elections,\" Jason Carter said. \"(But) we couldn\u2019t go be this incredible democracy and human rights organization overseas without ensuring that we were adding our voice and our expertise ... in the U.S.\" Ahead of theU.S. midterm elections, the center has asked candidates -- regardless of party -- to sign onto a set of fair election principles, including committing to the peaceful transfer of power. Among those who have signed commitments: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carter himself has mostly retreated from politics. For years after his 1980 defeat, Democrats steered clear of him. He enjoyed a resurgence in recent election cycles, drawing visits from several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and, in 2021, from President Joe Biden, who in 1976 was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter\u2019s presidential bid. With inflation now at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s, some Republicans are bringing up Carter again as an attack line on Biden and Democrats. Jason Carter said the former president reads and watches the news daily, and sometimes accepts calls or visits from political figures. But, he added, the former president isn\u2019t expected to appear publicly to endorse any candidates ahead of November. \"His people that he feels sort of the closest connection with now are the folks in Plains, at his church and other places,\" Jason Carter said. \"But, you know, his partner No. 1, 2 and 3 is my grandma, right? He has outlived friends and so many of his advisers and the people that he accomplished so much with in the past, but they\u2019ve never been lonely because they\u2019ve always had each other.\"",

        " \n        By\n        Lawrence Richard   | Fox News ",
        " An Arizona judge rejected a plea fromPlanned Parenthoodon Friday to suspend a previous rule that halts all abortions in the state. Last Friday, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson announced a decision to allow enforcement of a pre-statehood law that makes it a crime toperform an abortion.This Friday, she rejected the appeal to suspend that ruling. In her decision, Johnson said abortion rights groups are not likely to prevail in appealing her initial decision so the abortion ban should remain enforceable. Both rulings specifically prevent the state\u2019s abortion providers from performing abortion procedures after theU.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 24 decisionto overturn Roe v. Wade, which determined that a woman had a constitutional right to abortion. PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOCTOR TELLS CONGRESS MEN CAN GET PREGNANT: \u2018THIS IS MEDICINE\u2019 Following the June decision, legal battles sparked across the country, including the Pima County feud, over the legality of abortion. On Sept. 23, Johnson ruled that a 1973 injunction must be lifted so that the Civil War-era law criminalizing abortion could be enforced. Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate urged Johnson on Monday to suspend her ruling \u2014 citing the injunction\u2019s 50 years in effect as precedence \u2014 as they seek an appeal to a state abortion ban. MEGAN RAPINOE \u2018100% SUPPORTIVE OF TRANS INCLUSION,\u2019 IMPLORES PEOPLE TO LOOK AT ISSUE MORE BROADLY On Saturday, a law enacted by the state Legislature last spring banning abortion at 15 weeks took effect. The law was signed by Gov. Doug Ducey. PLANNED PARENTHOOD EDITS FACT SHEET TO SAY NO HEARTBEAT AT 6 WEEKS OF FETAL DEVELOPMENT Brittany Fonteno, Planned Parenthood of Arizona President and CEO, said she was \"outraged\" by the ruling. \"It is impermissible that Arizonans are waking up each morning to theirelected officialsmaking conflicting statements about which laws are in effect or claiming that they do not know, and yet the court has refused to provide any clarity or relief,\" Fonteno said. Some clinics in Arizona have been referring patients to providers in California andNew Mexico. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Civil War-era law penalizes violators, such as doctors or anyone else who assists in abortion, with a sentence of two to five years in prison. The Legislature previously repealed a law that allowed the women who seek abortions to be penalized. Arizona and 13 other states have banned abortions since Roe was overturned.

        " ADemocratic Texas mayoron Friday said she did not believe migrants who cross the border and find themselves transported north to various locations across the U.S. are being \"lied to.\" Mayor pro-tem of Eagle Pass, Texas, Yolanda Ramon told Fox News that she thinks migrants who cross into the U.S. appreciate the ride further inland. \"I can tell you one thing, they\u2019re not being lied to. You run into them at the gas station, they\u2019ll tell you I just want to go somewhere. I just want to go further up north,\" she said. \"They don\u2019t even know where they\u2019re at sometimes,\" she continued. \"They\u2019ll ask how far is San Antonio? How far is Houston?

Republicans frustrated by the Biden administration\u2019s response to what they deem as an \"immigration crisis\" made headlines earlier this year by busing or flying groups of migrants all over the country, including to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts and in front of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 residence in Washington, D.C. NYC RESIDENT RIPS MAYOR ADAMS OVER MIGRANT TENT CITY, RISING CRIME: 'PRISONER IN MY OWN HOME' Roughly half a dozen buses made their way from the southern border to New York City this week adding to the more than11,000 migrants the Big Applehas received since May. At least 41 migrants piled off a bus early Friday and were received by theNew York Port Authority,including nine men, 18 women and 15 children from El Paso.

    "GOP-led states sue Biden administration in response to student loan handout plan": [
        " \n        By\n        Landon Mion   | Fox News ",
        " Six Republican-led states are suing theBiden administrationover its proposal to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans. The states \u2014 Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Carolina and Arkansas \u2014 are accusing the administration of overstepping its executive powers without authorization from Congress. Iowa has a Democratic attorney general, but Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed on the state's behalf. President Joe Biden said in August his administration would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans, leading conservatives to question the legality of the plan and the political motivation of the move given that the midterm elections are coming up. But the administration this week quietly scaled back eligibility requirements for the debt relief. Now, borrowers with loans guaranteed by the federal government but held by private lenders are ineligible for debt cancelation, according to the Education Department. CNN, MSNBC AVOID BIDEN'S \u2018WHER\u2019S JACKIE?' SNAFU AFTER OBSESSING OVER TRUMP'S \u2018TIM APPLE\u2019 GAFFE The department updated its website Thursday to say that borrowers with federal loans owned by private banks will now be ineligible under Biden's plan unless they consolidated their loans into the government\u2019s direct lending program before Thursday. The change will impact about 770,000 borrowers, the department said. The GOP statesargue in the lawsuit, filed Thursday in a federal court in Missouri, that Biden\u2019s plan is \"not remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers,\" which is required under the 2003 federal law the administration is using to claim its legality. The states highlight that Biden said in an interview last month that the COVID-19 pandemic is over, but is continuing to use the ongoing health emergency to justify the debt relief. \"It's patently unfair to saddle hard-working Americans with the loan debt of those who chose to go to college,\" Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, who is leading the lawsuit, said in an interview. \"The Department of Education is required, under the law, to collect the balance due on loans. And President Biden does not have the authority to override that,\" she continued. The lawsuit said Missouri's loan servicer is facing a number of \"ongoing financial harms\" due to the student loan forgiveness. The states allege that Missouri's loan servicer will lose revenue from loans it owns through the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which had allowed private banks to authorize and manage federally backed student loans until the program ended in 2010. ARIZONA AG SUES BIDEN TO STOP \u2018ILLEGAL\u2019 STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT Other states that joined the lawsuit argue that the president's debt relief proposal will ultimately disrupt revenue to state coffers. The administration maintains its belief that the forgiveness program sits on solid legal ground. \"Republican officials from these six states are standing with special interests, and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt,\" White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan said Thursday. \"The president and his administration are lawfully giving working and middle-class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January.\" Biden's plan will cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for people making less than $125,000 or households making less than $250,000. Borrowers who meet the income limit and received a Pell Grant, aid given to applicants most in need financially, will have a total of $20,000 in debt forgiven. The administration also said it would extend the current pause on federal student loan repayments through the end of the year. This hold on payments began near the start of the pandemic. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Republican officialshave slammed the proposal as an unfair government giveaway for relatively affluent people and that it will cost individuals who did not pursue a college degree. Democratic lawmakers in tough reelection races have distanced themselves from the student loan forgiveness plan. The GOP has also attacked Biden's plan over its price tag and impact on the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the program will cost about $400 billion over the next three decades, but the White House said the CBO's estimate of the $21 billion the plan will cost in its first year alone is lower than what the administration initially expected.

        " Hurricane Ian is blowing awayall other news. That Jan. 6 committee hearing, scheduled for yesterday? Canceled. Other political news? Barely a blip on the radar. Harsh partisanship? Joe Bidenand Ron DeSantis spokefor some time about how best to help Florida \u2013 this after a day when the president appeared to snub the governor and drew flak for it. MEDIA DISMISS TRUMP-BACKED NOMINEES AS LOSERS, BUT MANY REMAIN COMPETITIVE Some life-threatening events are so grave that the usual maneuvering and game playing has to be put on hold. Hurricane Ian is just that kind of threat. TheCategory 4 stormmade landfall at 3:05 p.m. eastern yesterday at the town of Punta Gorda, about 100 miles south of Tampa. The 150 mph winds mounted a furious assault on the palm trees, and as it approached the state\u2019s western coast you could already see some cars in Naples almost totally submerged. Earlier the Democratic-controlled committee played it cute by leaking the Roger Stone video, first to CNN and then to other networks, on Tuesday to build interest for yesterday\u2019s scheduled hearing. I\u2019ve never understood why the panel gives away its scoops in advance, but by the time the hearing takes place, the Stone video that\u2019s been all over the airwaves is really going to seem like old news. This is the video right before the 2020 election where the longtime Donald Trump pal and GOP operative says \"f*** the voting, let\u2019s get right to the violence\u2026 Shoot to kill, see an antifa, shoot to kill\" and says the president should use armed guards to turn away any Electoral College electors. Stone had cooperated with the project by two Danish filmmakers, yet is ludicrously calling the video a deep fake. As for the hurricane, the greatest danger comes not from the impact itself but fromflooding and storm surgesafterward. Eight months after Katrina, I went to New Orleans and was stunned by endless miles of abandoned homes, stretching out to the suburbs, children\u2019s toys and household products still strewn across the lawns \u2013 so great was the damage by the subsequent flooding. The media had mainly moved on, but the area was changed forever by the devastation. George W. Bush took a major political hit when Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, remaining on vacation and then flying over the devastated city in Air Force One, with some people still stranded on rooftops. \"I realized I had made a serious mistake,\" he wrote in his memoir. \"The photo of me hovering over the damage suggested I was detached from the suffering on the ground.\" TRUMP ON THE COUCH: WHAT HE SPILLED TO MAGGIE HABERMAN His reputation was further tarnished by his \"heckuva job, Brownie\" remarks when FEMA was botching its handling of the storm. It\u2019s inevitablethat both Bidenand DeSantis will be judged by their response to Hurricane Ian. This is a moment of testing for political leaders, just as mayors plummet in popularity for failing to clear the roads after a blizzard. At the same time, DeSantis will undoubtedly avoid Chris Christie\u2019s political blunder in embracing Barack Obama when he came to New Jersey to look at the damage from Superstorm Sandy.

    "Media dismiss Trump-backed nominees as losers, but many remain competitive": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " The media are hammering home a message: many of theultra-conservative candidateswho won their nominations with Donald Trump\u2019s backing are in deep trouble. With less than six weeks to go in the midterms, we hear and see versions of that consensus virtually every day. It is the frame through which they are covering the election, especially the razor-thin battle for control of the Senate, that happens to favor the Democrats hanging on. In some cases, this might be on target. But overall, what if it\u2019s flat wrong? After all, it was New York Times analyst Nate Cohn who said the polling (which all of this hinges on) may be wrong. It was wrong in 2016 and 2020, overestimating Democratic support in the same areas, and nothing has been done to fix it. TRUMP ON THE COUCH: WHAT HE SPILLED TO MAGGIE HABERMAN There are big wild cards this year. Will the election be a referendum on Trump or Joe Biden, whose low-key approach keeps him out of the news except when he\u2019s attacking MAGA Republicans? And how energizing will theabortion rights issuebe in turning out Democratic voters? Keep in mind that candidates playing to their base in the primary and inching toward the center in the general is as old as American politics. First you\u2019ve got to win the nomination to have a chance. That\u2019s why Blake Masters, in the Arizona Senate race, quickly scrubbed his website of anti-abortion and personhood amendment rhetoric, along with 2020-election-was-stolen language. The Washington Post makes the case that \"candidate popularity presentsa significant and unnecessary hurdle in what should, historically speaking, be a good election for Republicans.\" (The paper doesn\u2019t rule out GOP victories, though.) After reviewing polls in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the Post said that \"in most cases, the Trump-aligned candidates that observers have pegged as being potential liabilities in those states look like exactly that.\" In the Pennsylvania Senate race,one poll showed 29% like Dr. Oz while 53% dislike him. Another poll showed 36% of Trump voters dislike him. But Democrat John Fetterman has only \"middling approval numbers,\" though more than a 20-point edge over Oz on net favorability. The race remains competitive, especially given the stroke factor. In Ohio, polls show Democrat Tim Ryan with a \"net image rating\" 12 to 20 points higher than J.D. Vance. Yet the story admits the race is \"neck and neck,\" which sort of undercuts the premise. In theMichigan governor\u2019s race,GOP challenger Tudor Dixon is at 24 favorable/44 unfavorable in one recent poll. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s numbers on that score are 28 points higher. I don\u2019t think Dixon helped herself by joking about the plot to kidnap the Democratic governor, which has led to convictions. And in New Hampshire, Sen. Maggie Hassan was thought to be in deep trouble, but while GOP challenger Don Bolduc is negative 17 points on fav/unfav, Hassan is negative 9. Bolduc had been an election denier, but retracted that view after winning the nomination. \"I\u2019ve spent the past couple weeks talking to Granite Staters all over the state from every party, and I have come to the conclusion \u2014 and I want to be definitive on this \u2014 the election was not stolen,\" Bolduc told Fox News in a clear 180. But sometimes the challengers sputter. The New York Times reports that Doug Mastriano,Pennsylvania\u2019s GOP gubernatorial nomineewho chartered buses to the Jan. 6 rally and has vowed to ban abortions without exceptions \u2013 is having a rough time. NY ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES TRUMP OF CIVIL FRAUD, BUT UNDER A CLOUD OF PARTISANSHIP At a weekend rally he appeared \"before a crowd of just a few dozen \u2014 about half of whom were volunteers for his ragtag campaign for governor of Pennsylvania\u2026 \"He is being heavily outspent by his Democratic rival, has had no television ads on the air since May, has chosen not to interact with the state\u2019s news media in ways that would push his agenda, and trails by double digits in reputable public polling and most private surveys.\" The paper\u2019s conclusion: \"It is one thing to win a crowded GOP primary on the back of online fame and Donald J. Trump\u2019s endorsement, it is quite another to prevail in a general election in a battleground state of nearly 13 million people.\" Thus, we see the message again and again:These Trump-backed peopleare just too extreme to win this fall \u2013 although the polls, as I said, may be wrong. Plus, NBC reports that in a 2019 radio interview, state Sen. Mastriano was pushing a ban on abortion after six weeks, and said any woman who violated that law should be charged with murder. At the same time, personality matters.In Georgia, Herschel Walkerhas been battered by admissions and allegations, including from his ex-wife, that would sink most candidates. Yet he remains tied in the race against Sen. Raphael Warnock. SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES And sometimes the candidates suffer self-inflicted wounds. Kari Lake, the Trump-backed nomineefor Arizona governor,made a huge deal of a video attacking Democrat Katie Hobbs: \"In Hobbs's Arizona, your kindergartner wouldn't learn the Pledge of Allegiance.

    "Trump on the couch: What he spilled to Maggie Haberman": [
        " \n        By\n        Howard Kurtz   | Fox News ",
        " When I was based in New York in the 1980s, and regularlyinterviewed Donald Trump,there was a pattern to our conversations that would become familiar to the world during his presidency. He always called me back quickly, punctuated the calls with flattery \u2013 you\u2019re a great writer, etc. \u2013 and forcefully offered his spin on the subject du jour, even about his divorce battle with his first wife. When he wrote a scathing personal letter to hotel queen Leona Helmsley, he faxed me a copy. Then he\u2019d hop off quickly \u2013 \"I gotta go, baby. You take care. I\u2019ll read you tomorrow.\" But once in a while Trump would slam me, as when I asked a skeptical question about his strugglingAtlantic City casinos,which would later go belly up. \"I don\u2019t know why I even talk to you,\" the celebrity businessman snapped. \"You\u2019ve never written anything nice about me.\" That was demonstrably untrue, but in any event, he still returned my calls. When I started covering his candidacy in 2015, Trump once praised me at a press conference, and sat for six interviews for my show. But when I bumped into him in the White House on one of his first days in office, he half-jokingly complained in front of his staff that I\u2019d \"gone neutral\" on him. That was actually my job, but in his view, it was like a dirty word, meaning that I couldn\u2019t be counted on to back him a thousand percent. NY ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES TRUMP OF CIVIL FRAUD, BUT UNDER A CLOUD OF PARTISANSHIP That history made me think of Maggie Haberman,the New York Times reporterwho first started covering Trump as a tabloid scribe and never quite stopped. He would give her access, and then tweet that she was a \"third-rate reporter\" when he was ticked off about a story. Yet after leaving office Trump granted her three lengthy interviews for her forthcoming book, \"Confidence Man,\" a broad biography. The Atlantic just published an excerpt. It struck a chord when Haberman wrote: \"I have found myself on the receiving end of the two types of behavior Donald Trump exhibits toward reporters: his relentless desire to hold the media\u2019s gaze, and his poison-pen notes and angry statements in response to coverage.\" Here is a telling excerpt about running for president (he had told me in 1987 that if he ran, he\u2019d win, prompting one of his associates to call him out of touch with reality. That didn\u2019t age well.) \"\u2018The question I get asked more than any other question: If you had it to do again, would you have done it?\u2019 The answer is, yeah, I think so. Because here\u2019s the way I look at it. I have so many rich friends and nobody knows who they are.\u2019 He then went on to talk about how much easier his life would have been had he not run. Yet there it was: Reflecting on the meaning of having beenpresident of the United States,his first impulse was not to mention public service, or what he felt he\u2019d accomplished, only that it appeared to be a vehicle for fame, and that many experiences were only worth having if someone else envied them.\" (In fairness, Haberman quotes Trump as saying \"getting things done\" in a later interview when she asked what he liked about the job.) The former president admired onetime Brooklyn Democratic machine leader Meade Esposito for ruling with an \"iron fist,\" the same phrase he applies to such foreign strongmen as Xi Jinping. He says he thought Mitch McConnell would be that way but now says \"the Old Crow\u2019s a piece of s***.\" The Republican leader famously broke with Trump after Jan. 6. Of comparisons to Chris Christie, who\u2019s been bashing Trump of late: \"I didn\u2019t know I had that big of a weight problem\u2026 He\u2019s an opportunist.\" The 45th president didn\u2019t really believe he would be reinstated \u2013 an idea pushed by the MyPillow guy \u2013 but encouraged Rich Lowry and other conservative writers to suggest that as a way of keeping it out there. THE LATEST THREAT TO DEMOCRACY? THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION IS HURTING DEMS Trump denies giving Jared Kushner sweeping powers, but when pressed: \"Look, my daughter has a great relationship with him and that\u2019s very important.\" On newsworthy subjects, Trump insisted to Haberman he was not watching television on Jan. 6, as numerous witnesses have testified. He was meeting with Mark Meadows and others and found out late about the violence. In similar fashion, he said he didn\u2019t take any documents of note to Mar-a-Lago, and said hisletters from Kim Jong-unwere with the National Archives, but Trump didn\u2019t return them until after the Washington Post reported on them at the beginning of this year. At one point Trump turned to two aides who had joined an interview with Haberman, and declared,\u00a0\"I love being with her, she\u2019s like my psychiatrist.\" SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES \"The reality is that he treats everyone like they are his psychiatrists \u2014 reporters, government aides, and members of Congress, friends and pseudo-friends and rally attendees and White House staff and customers.

For nearly eight years now, supporters and critics alike, along with social media posters, have tried to psychoanalyze Trump: Why did he say this, tweet that, attack this person, defend that person, not appear to know or care how things worked? It\u2019s part of the secret sauce that, in marked contrast tolow-key Joe Biden, has seemingly everyone debating Trump\u2019s state of mind all the time. And there\u2019s no hourly fee.",

    "PolitiFact focuses fact-checks more on Biden's critics than president himself, study finds": [
        " \n        By\n        Brian Flood   | Fox News ",
        " It turns out \"fact-checkers\" at Politifact are more concerned with making sure critics ofPresident Bidenare held accountable than the White House itself, according to a new study. During Biden\u2019s first 20 months in office, there were 58 pieces published by Politifact to fact-check the president compared to a staggering 338 pieces designed to fact-check Biden critics, according to theMedia Research Center's NewsBusters. \"Overall, there were 5.8 fact checks of Biden critics for every one of the president,\" NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham wrote. Politifact, a product of The Poynter Institute, uses a \"Truth-O-Meter\" to determine if claims are \"True,\" \"Mostly True,\" \"Half True,\" \"Mostly False,\" \"False\" or the dreaded \"Pants on Fire.\" The website insists \"fact-checking journalism is the heart of PolitiFact,\" and claims its \"core principles are independence, transparency, fairness, thorough reporting and clear writing.\" CNN'S FACT-CHECKER CONTINUES STRONG FOCUS ON REPUBLICANS, PAYS BIDEN LITTLE ATTENTION However, not everyone agrees that the organization has nonpartisan intentions. Conservative strategist Chris Barron believes groups like PolitiFact \"could serve a useful purpose, by serving to fairly and consistently compare what a politician said to the objective facts,\" but that\u2019s not what\u2019s currently happening. \"Unfortunately, PolitiFact has instead chosen to weaponize their work for partisan political purposes. They don\u2019t care about holding politicians accountable, what they care about is protecting progressives while demonizing conservatives,\" Barron told Fox News Digital. The MRC study indicated that Biden\u2019s critics are treated particularly harshly. \"Over his first year and a half, Biden landed on the \u2018Mostly False\u2019 or worse side in 28 of 58 fact checks (48 percent). But the \u2018Fact Checks About Joe Biden\u2019 were overwhelmingly negative \u2013 298 out of 338 were \u2018Mostly False\u2019 or worse (88 percent). There were only three that were \u2018True,\u2019 six that were \u2018Mostly True\u2019 -- making 9 out of 338 (2.6 percent). Another 31 were \u2018Half True,\u2019\" Graham wrote. \"There were\u00a0zero \u2018Pants on Fire\u2019 rulings about President Biden\u00a0in his first 20 months. By contrast,\u00a0Donald Trump has 10\u00a0in that time span.\" Biden only has six \"Pants on Fire\" fact-checks since Politifact began in 2007, the MRC noted. \"Biden could say the evacuation from Afghanistan was an \u2018extraordinary success,\u2019 and we have \u2018zero percent\u2019 inflation, and there were no factual objections. On April 22, he claimed he was a \u2018full professor\u2019 for four years at the University of Pennsylvania, which is simply false. They called it\u00a0\u2018Half True,\u2019\" Graham added. \"But there have been\u00a079 \u2018Pants on Fire' rulings against Biden critics\u00a0in the first 20 months of his presidency.\" Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson said Politifact is like the proverbial broken clock. \"It sometimes gets the result right, but far too often seems to bend over backwards to sway it's 'fact checks' as a defense mechanism to protect Democrats,\" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. \"It is not surprising that the numbers show a bias in which stories Politifact checks.\" MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S 'INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKERS' ARE IN LOCKSTEP AND THEY ALWAYS TILT LEFT, NEVER RIGHT Conservative radio host Jason Rantz believes many fact-checking outlets essentially serve as publicists forDemocratic politicians. \"It allows media outlets to claim Republicans are lying and Democrats are victims of dishonest conservatives,\" Rantz told Fox News Digital. \"But there are few fact-checkers who oversee the fact-checkers. Just because a partisan fact-checking site, like Politifact, makes a claim, doesn't mean it's accurate,\" Rantz continued. \"And bias works here in a pretty subtle way -- it's what it chooses to fact-check that allows them to manipulate the media narrative and attack politicians it doesn't support. The best way to avoid this trap is to fact-check things yourself.\" DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall agrees that there is \"clearly\" a bias in the fact-checking world. \"Fact-checkers have much discretion in deciding who or what needs to be fact-checked in the first place.\u00a0There is a flood of information floating around in the public sphere and fact-checkers must necessarily be selective in what they choose to scrutinize,\" McCall told Fox News Digital. \"Any fact-checker who chooses to be a partisan or advocate can certainly tilt their analyses in their favored direction.\u00a0This would seem to be the case, based on the NewsBusters study,\" McCall added. FORMER CNN HOST BRIAN STELTER GETS HARVARD FELLOWSHIP DISCUSSING \u2018THREATS TO DEMOCRACY\u2019 He believes that Politifact seems to \"demonstrate so little rigor\" in assessing Biden's claims and statements that the fact-checks are unhelpful to refereeing the public sphere. \"If there is one person on the planet who needs rigorous fact-checking, it is the leader of the free world.\u00a0 Everything a president says is potentially a history-changing matter, and the accuracy of a president's remarks is essential,\" McCall said. \"Fact-checking of a presidential critic, on the other hand, while useful, is less essential on a broad scale.\" Politifact isn't alone, asCNN's Daniel Dalelists fact-checking the president as first among his duties on his Twitter bio, but it's hardly his only focus. He recently went three months without fact-checking the president, and regularly posts articles focusing on conservatives. In January, Fox News Digital reported on a six-week gap on Dale's fact-checks of Biden, noting he hadignored false claimsby the president in a landmark voting rights speech in Georgia. McCall noted that many more citizens will hear what a president says on any matter of public interest than will ever hear what random critics have to say. \"Thus, fact-checkers who are really interested in confirming truth in the nation's dialogue should do more scrutiny of a president and worry less about critics shouting from the cheap seats,\" he said. The Poynter Institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fox News' David Rutz contributed to this report. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "Supreme Court poised to keep marching to right in new term": [
        "By MARK SHERMAN and JESSICA GRESKOOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Withpublic confidencediminished andjustices sparring openlyover the institution\u2019s legitimacy, theSupreme Courton Monday will begin a new term that could push American law to the right on issues of race, voting and the environment. Following June\u2019s momentousoverturning of nearly 50 years of constitutional protections for abortion rights, the court is diving back in with an aggressive agenda that seems likely to split its six conservativejusticesfrom its three liberals. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a sleepy term,\u201d said Allison Orr Larsen, a William and Mary law professor. \u201cCases the court already has agreed to hear really have the potential to bring some pretty significant changes to the law.\u201d Into this swirling mix steps newJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black woman. Jackson took the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, who retired in June. She\u2019s not expected to alter the liberal-conservative divide on the court, but for the first time the court has four women as justices and white men no longer hold a majority. The court, with three appointees of President Donald Trump, could discarddecades of decisions that allow colleges to take account of race in admissionsand againweaken the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, the crown jewel of the civil rights movement. In a separate elections case, aRepublican-led appealcould dramatically change the way elections for Congress and the presidency are conducted by handing more power to state legislatures and taking it away from state courts. Also on the agenda is a clash over the rights of a business owner with a religious objection to working with same-sex couples on their weddings. In the term\u2019s first arguments Monday, the justices are being asked tolimit the reach of the Clean Water Act, nation\u2019s main law to combat water pollution. The case involves an Idaho couple who won an earlier high court round in their bid to build a house on property near a lake without getting a permit under that law. The outcome could change the rules for millions of acres of property that contain wetlands. A Supreme Court decision for the couple could strip environmental protections from 45 million acres and threaten water quality for millions of people, said Sam Sankar, senior vice president of the Earthjustice environmental group. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help a lot of industries. It\u2019s going to hurt real people,\u201d Sankar said. But Damien Schiff, representing the couple, said a favorable court ruling could free ordinary property owners from worrying about large fines and years of delays. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a large industrial company or large property owner to have a problem,\u201d Schiff said. There\u2019s little expectation that the outcomes in the highest-profile cases will be anything other than conservative victories, following last term\u2019s outcomes.In their first full termtogether,the conservativesruled not only on abortion, but expanded gun rights, enhanced religious rights, reined in the government\u2019s ability to fight climate change and limited Biden administration efforts to combat COVID-19. Deborah Archer, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, underscored the long odds facing defenders ofaffirmative action in college admissions. \u201cIt is most certainly an uphill climb. We\u2019re in a scary place where we are relying on Justice Roberts,\u201d Archer said. Her assessment stems from Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 long-standing support, both as a judge and a White House lawyer in the 1980s, for limits on considerations of race in education and voting. \u201cIt\u2019s a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,\u201d Roberts wrote in a 2006 redistricting case from Texas. Last term\u2019s epic decisions might have produced bruised feelings among the justices anyway. Butthe leak of the abortion decision in early May, seven weeks before it was released, exacerbated tensions on the court, several justices have said. The court has apparently not identified the source of the leak,Breyer said in a recent interview on CNN. Justice Elena Kagan delivered a series of talks over the summer in which she said the public\u2019s view of the court can be damaged especially when changes in its membership lead to big changes in the law. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t look like law when some new judges appointed by a new president come in and start just tossing out the old stuff,\u201d Kagan said in an appearance last month at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island. Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito both took issue with Kagan, if obliquely. Roberts said it was wrong to equate disagreement with the court\u2019s decisions with questions of legitimacy. In a comment Tuesday to The Wall Street Journal, Alito didn\u2019t name Kagan. \u201cBut saying or implying that the court is becoming an illegitimate institution or questioning our integrity crosses an important line,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper. Separately,Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas,was interviewedon Thursday by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. She stood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent, according to the committee chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. Ginni Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, texted with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows andcontacted lawmakersin Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election. In January, her husband was the only justice to vote to keep documents from the National Archives out of the committee\u2019s hands. Polls have shown a dip in approval for the court and respect for it. The latest Gallup Poll, released last week, reflected Americans\u2019 lowest level of trust in the court in 50 years and a record-tying low approval rating. In a talk to judges and lawyers in Colorado last month, Roberts reflected on the last year at the court, calling it an \u201can unusual one and difficult in many respects.\u201d Following the leak, the court was ringed with an8-foot security fence, and Roberts called it \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d to drive to work past the barricades. He also said it was \u201cunnatural\u201d to hear arguments without the public present, a concession to the coronavirus pandemic. Now the barricades are down and thepublic will be allowed inside the courtroomfor arguments for the first time since March 2020. The court will keep one pandemic practice, broadcasting live audio of arguments. Roberts seemed eager to look ahead. \u201cI think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate in the year is the best way to respond to it,\u201d he said. Last term, the court moved \u201cfirmly in a rightward direction,\u201d said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University\u2019s law school. \u201cThere is no reason to think this coming term or any term in the foreseeable future will be any different.\u201d ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",

    "US Army misses recruiting goal; other services squeak by": [
        "By LOLITA C. BALDOROctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Army fell about 15,000 soldiers \u2014 or 25% \u2014 short of its recruitment goal this year, officials confirmed Friday, despite a frantic effort to make up the widely expected gap in a year whenall the military services struggled in a tight jobs market to find young peoplewilling and fit to enlist. While the Army was the only service that didn\u2019t meet its target, all of the others had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry applicants, which will put them behind as they begin the next recruiting year on Saturday. The worsening problem stirs debate about whether America\u2019s fighting force should be restructured or reduced in size if the services can\u2019t recruit enough, and could also put added pressure on the National Guard and Reserve to help meet mission requirements. According to officials, the Marine Corps, which usually goes into each fiscal year with as much as 50% of its recruiting goal already locked in, has only a bit more than 30%. And the Air Force and the Navy will only have about 10% of their goals as they start the new fiscal year. The Air Force usually has about 25%. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details on the recruiting totals that have not yet been released. \u201cIn the Army\u2019s most challenging recruiting year since the start of the all-volunteer force, we will only achieve 75% of our fiscal year 22 recruiting goal,\u201d Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe Army will maintain its readiness and meet all our national security requirements. If recruiting challenges persist, we will draw on the Guard and Reserve to augment active-duty forces, and may need to trim our force structure.\u201d Officials said the Army brought in about 45,000 soldiers during the fiscal year that ended Friday. The goal was 60,000. The Air Force, meanwhile, was able to pull enough recruits from its delayed entry pool to exactly met its goal to bring in 26,151 recruits this year. \u201cUsing Air Force lexicon, I would say we\u2019re doing a dead stick landing as we come into the end of fiscal \u201922, and we\u2019re going to need to turn around on the first of October and do an afterburner takeoff,\u201d Maj. Gen. Edward Thomas, head of the Air Force Recruiting Service, said at a conference last week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be starting 2023 in a tougher position than we started 2022.\u201d Military leaders used increased enlistment bonuses and other programs to try and build their numbers this year, but they say it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to compete with private industry in the tight labor market. And as they look to the future, they worry that if the declining enlistment trends continue, the Pentagon may have to reassess its force requirements and find ways to make the military a more attractive profession to the eroding number of young Americans who can meet mental and physical requirements for service. Early this year, military leaders were already braced for a bad recruiting season. The Army, for example, announced several months ago that it would have toadjust the expected size of its total forcethis year from 476,000 to about 466,000. The large recruiting shortfall was offset a bit by the Army\u2019s ability to exceed its retention goal \u2014 keeping 104% of the targeted number of troops in the service. The causes for the recruiting struggles are many and varied. Two years of the pandemic shut off recruiters\u2019 access to schools, public events, fairs and other youth organizations where they often find prospects. Moving to online recruiting \u2014 as in-person meetings closed down \u2014 was only marginally successful. And some of the in-person access has been slow to open up again. At the same time, companies like McDonalds are now wooing workers with tuition benefits and other increased perks that for years made the military an attractive profession. Military leaders say that they are suffering from the same labor shortage that has restaurants, airlines, shops and other businesses desperately scraping for workers. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that according to estimates, just 23% of young people can meet the military\u2019s fitness, educational and moral requirements \u2014 with many disqualified for reasons ranging from medical issues to criminal records and tattoos. \u201cWe remain committed to maintaining our standards, investing in America\u2019s youth, and emphasizing quality over quantity,\u201d Gen. James McConville, chief of staff of the Army said. It\u2019s unclear how much the debate over the COVID-19 vaccine is playing in the recruiting struggles. So far, the Army has discharged a bit more than 1,700 soldiers for refusing to take the mandated vaccine. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the overall force size. At the same time, the patriotism that fueled the rush to military service in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks has dimmed. Some may look around and see no more wars and terrorists to fight so they look elsewhere. And others see lucrative hiring campaigns by private industry and know the salaries will be better than military pay, and they will be less likely to end up wounded or killed in those jobs. The services are grappling with a number of new programs and other changes to beef up recruiting but face lingering questions about how best to convince young people that military life is a viable option for them. During a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the recruiting challenges, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., challenged the services to \u201cthink outside the box, creating new career paths, offering innovative pay and incentive structures, and realigning some capabilities from military to civilian workforces should all be on the table.\u201d",

    "Cha-ching! Biden embraces his election-year fundraising role": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIM and AAMER MADHANIOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Whenever a donor\u2019s unsilenced cellphone goes off at a fundraiser while President Joe Biden is talking, he has the same joke ready to go: It\u2019s Donald Trump on the other line. \u201cIf that\u2019s Trump calling me again, tell him I\u2019m busy,\u201d Biden said at an event this past week for the Democratic Governors Association, repeating a variation of the quip he also relayed during receptions in Illinois and New York earlier this year. The crowd of a few dozen, as they always do, chuckled as the president continued with the rest of his remarks. It\u2019s one glimpse of Biden as fundraiser in chief \u2014 a man who schmoozes with aplomb while raking in millions at receptions that will be a fixture of his political schedule during the final stretch before Election Day, Nov. 8. At these events, celebrities are spotted and alcohol is consumed, while Biden gets the one-on-one interactions he had missed for much of his campaign and presidency due to COVID-19. The fundraisers \u2014 held in lavish Manhattan apartments, drab conference centers and backyard tents glammed up with chandeliers \u2014 have been one of themost visible ways Biden has been deployedthis election year at a time when hisapproval ratings remain underwaterand manyDemocrats aren\u2019t eager to stand by himon the campaign trail. \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden. He\u2019s real, he\u2019s down to earth, if he knows the people in the room \u2026 he\u2019s even more relaxed,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a close ally. \u201cHe gets all kinds of questions, he answers them honestly, he probably gives his staff heart attacks.\u201d So far this year, Biden has headlined 11 receptions to raise cash directly for the Democratic National Committee, and they have brought in more than $19.6 million, according to the committee. The events have ranged from a $300,000 haul at a yacht club in Portland, Oregon, to acozy, 18-person affair(with four others on video screens) at Hotel Washington near the White House that took in more than $3 million. A pair of fundraisersat mansions in Southern Californiaduring the Summit of the Americas in June raked in $5 million in a matter of hours. Separate from the DNC events, Biden spoke at a fundraiser in September benefiting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that brought in more than $450,000 for the state Democratic Party. The governors association event raised $1 million, and Biden was to have appeared on Tuesday at a fundraiser on behalf of Charlie Crist, the nominee for governor in Florida who has not been shy about wanting the president to campaign with him. That political trip was postponed due to Hurricane Ian. The DNC also enlists Biden for solicitations sent to its grassroots donor list, with emails signed by the president consistently raising the most money for the committee, party officials say. As of this past week, the DNC has raised more than $107 million, the most at this point in any year and an amount that Democratic officials credited in large part to Biden\u2019s direct involvement. Biden seems to particularly relish the in-person interactions that a private fundraiser offers. A famously chummy politician, Biden makes sure at any big-dollar event that his hosts are made to feel special and recognized. For instance, at a late August fundraiser in the Washington suburbs, Biden first spent some time giving a child near the front of the gathering a bit of attention and then the president gave his remarks for several dozen big-dollar DNC supporters. \u201cHoney, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Biden asked a little girl, sitting through what he joked had to be the most \u201cboring\u201d event. \u201cWell, let me tell you something. Is that your daddy? He owes you big for having to sit here.\u201d At a June fundraiser in Beverly Hills, California, at the home of billionaire media mogul Haim Saban, the president mused to Saban\u2019s wife, Cheryl, that both men had \u201cmarried way above our station.\u201d And standing in the 65th-floor apartment of Henry and Marsha Laufer overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park, Biden gushed over the \u201cmagnificent\u201d view, noting: \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a better view in New York than here.\u201d Indeed, the residence is a \u201cpiece of heaven\u201d for the Laufers, who appeared fastidious about keeping their place spotless. Attendees checked their shoes \u2013 expensive Jimmy Choo mules and Saint Laurent pumps among them \u2014 at the door and listened to Biden while in socks or slippers provided by the couple. A small group of reporters in attendance were asked to place \u201cbooties\u201d over their shoes to protect their hardwood floors and light-colored carpets. (None of the shoe rules applied to Biden, who kept his on and did not wear the disposable coverings.) At Biden fundraisers, celebrities such as the actor Robert De Niro (in New York) or filmmaker Ken Burns (in Boston) make the occasional cameo, although neither stayed long enough to hear the president speak. To donors, Biden\u2019s comments, which can run from a few minutes to a half-hour, are a much more casual,off-the-cuff version of the campaign speechthat he delivers in front of the cameras. Journalists have access to Biden fundraisers, although just with a notepad and pen, meaning cameras are barred. Especially as of late, Biden takes care to underline his administration\u2019s accomplishments \u2014 a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, a bipartisan infrastructure law, a climate and health care bill that came after months of internal Democratic wrangling. He then stresses to donors how theupcoming November midterms are a choice, not just between keeping his achievements and Republicans unraveling them, but on other issues such as abortion and guns. While aides dispute that his message varies in more private settings, Biden frequently speaks extemporaneously and can be far less guarded than at his formal remarks at a lectern or on a stage. It\u2019s been at fundraisers where Biden has invoked variations of fascism \u2013be it \u201csemi-fascism\u201d or \u201ctint of fascism\u201d-- to refer to Trump-fueled forces within the Republican Party that Biden has said are a threat to the nation\u2019s democratic foundations. While his spokeswoman declined to assess the implications ofthe recent election in Italy, where a political party with neo-fascist roots won the most votes, Biden at the DGA fundraiser pointed to the results as he warned about the fate of democracy both in the United States and abroad. At the Laufers\u2019 home, Biden \u2013 who tends to avoid talking about his faith when discussing policy \u2014 notably referenced the Catholic Church\u2019s position while castigating Republicans who had pushed for broad bans on abortion. \u201cI happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic. My church doesn\u2019t even make that argument,\u201d he said, referring to abortion bans that leave \u201cno exceptions.\u201d The quintessential Biden qualities \u2014 his candor and his warmth with the crowd \u2014 become more pronounced once the press is kicked out and audience members have a chance to ask Biden questions, say people who have attended such gatherings. The questions Biden gets vary from event to event and they veer from political strategy to the news of the day. During a Manhattan fundraiser at the home of businessman and social justice activist Henry Munoz, Biden was pressed on his plans on immigration and how he would describe his closing message to voters, as well as the impact of the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to relay details of a private event. The bulk of Biden\u2019s fundraising activity has been for the DNC, and Biden earlier this year greenlighted a $15 million transfer from it to the party\u2019s House and Senate campaign committees, a sign of his personal investment in trying to ensure Democrats retain their majorities this fall. A White House official said Biden receives \u201cquite a few\u201d requests from Democratic candidates to appear at fundraisers, and aides work to accommodate as many as possible depending on his schedule and other factors. Whitmer took priority because she was a co-chair of both Biden\u2019s presidential campaign and his inauguration. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Trump at center of Oath Keepers novel defense in Jan. 6 case": [
        "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The defense team in theCapitol riottrial of theOath Keepers leaderis relying on an unusual strategy with Donald Trump at the center. Lawyers for Stewart Rhodes, founder of theextremist group, are poised to argue thatjurorscannot find him guilty of seditious conspiracy because all the actions he took before the siege on Jan. 6, 2021, were in preparation for orders he anticipated from the then-president \u2014 orders that never came. Rhodes and four associates are accused of plotting for weeks to stop the transfer of presidential power from the Republican incumbent to Democrat Joe Biden, culminating with Oath Keepers in battle gear storming the Capitol alongside hundreds of other Trump supporters. Opening statements in the trial are set to begin Monday. Rhodes intends to take the stand to argue he believed Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act to call up a militia to support him, his lawyers have said. Trump didn\u2019t do that, but Rhodes\u2019 team says that what prosecutors allege was an illegal conspiracy was \u201cactually lobbying and preparation for the President to utilize\u201d the law. It\u2019s a novel legal argument in a trial that\u2019s one of the most serious cases coming out of the Capitol attack. \u201cThis is an incredibly complicated defense of theory and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s ever played out in this fashion in American jurisprudence,\u201d one of Rhodes\u2019 lawyers, James Lee Bright, told The Associated Press. The Insurrection Act gives a president broad authority to call up the military and decide what shape that force will take.Trump did float that kind of action at other points in his presidency. To succeed with this line of defense, Bright would have to convince a jury that Rhodes was waiting on the go-ahead from the president, which could be a major hurdle. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have argued Trump could have called up a militia in response to \u201cwhat he perceived as a conspiracy to deprive a class of persons in several states of their voting rights.\u201d Rhodes published an open letter on the Oath Keepers\u2019 website in December 2020 urging Trump to use the Insurrection Act to \u201c\u2018stop the steal\u2019 and defeat the coup.\u201d If Rhodes testifies, he could face intense questioning from prosecutors, who say his own words show the Oath Keepers would act no matter what Trump did. Bright said Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, understands the risks of testifying but has insisted since the first day they met that he be able to \u201cspeak his piece.\u201d Rhodes and his associates \u2014 Kelly Meggs, Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Kenneth Harrelson \u2014 are the first Jan. 6 defendants to be tried on seditious conspiracy, a rarely used Civil War-era charge that can be difficult to prove. The defense would have to convince the jury that the Oath Keepers really intended to defend the government, not use force against it, said David Alan Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor who\u2019s now a professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIf you think you are plotting to help protect the government, there is an argument that that means you don\u2019t have the required guilty mindset that\u2019s necessary in order to be guilty of seditious conspiracy,\u201d he said. Court records show the Oath Keepers repeatedly warning of the prospect of violence if Biden were to become president. The Oath Keepers amassed weapons and stationed armed \u201cquick reaction force\u201d teams at a Virginia hotel in case they were needed, prosecutors say. Among those likely to testify against Rhodes are three of his former followers, including one who has said Rhodes instructed them to be ready to use lethal force if necessary to keep Trump in the White House. Defense lawyers say the quick reaction force teams were defensive forces only to be used if Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. If Rhodes really wanted to lead a revolution, his lawyers say there was no better opportunity to deploy the quick reaction force than when hundreds of people were storming the Capitol. But the Oath Keepers never did. \u201cThe conditions would never be better. Yet, Rhodes and the others left the Capitol grounds and went to Olive Garden for dinner,\u201d they\u2019ve written in court papers. Rhodes never went into the Capitol and has said that the Oath Keepers who did acted on their own. The Insurrection Act is shorthand for a series of statutes that Congress passed between 1872 and 1871 defining when military force can be used in the United States by the federal government, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. The Act does give the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary, and what qualifies as military force, Vladeck said. The last time the Insurrection Act was used was in May of 1992, by President George H.W. Bush to call out the military to respond to Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of white police officers accused in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. Even if Trump had acted, prosecutors would still have a strong case that the Oath Keepers tried to keep Congress from carrying out its responsibilities as part of the transfer of presidential power, Vladeck said. Even if the president could authorize their actions, the Oath Keepers could still have been \u2014 as the law puts it \u2014 forcibly opposing other elements of the government, he said. \u201cThe government of the United States is more than just the president,\u201d Vladeck said. Michael Weinstein, a former Justice Department prosecutor, agreed that Rhodes\u2019 argument is not likely to win over a jury. But that may not be his only goal. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a show trial for him,\u201d said Weinstein, now a criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey. \u201cThis is his opportunity to really promote himself and his philosophy and make himself out to be a bit of a martyr.\u201d Trump did talk about sending in U.S. troops to American cities in summer 2020 as protesters filled the streets in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a police officer, an action that would have come under the Insurrection Act. He never did. Los Angeles-based defense lawyer Nina Marino said the Insurrection Act defense could work. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great defense from the 1800s resurrected into 2022,\u201d she said. But she added: \u201cIf there\u2019s evidence that they would have done it anyway, then I think that really, really damages the defense.\u201d Prosecutors have already pointed to a message from December 2020 that Rhodes wrote, saying Trump \u201cneeds to know that if he fails to act, then we will.\u201d Days before the riot, Rhodes warned that the \u201cfinal nail\u201d would be put in the \u201ccoffin of this Republic,\u201d unless they fought their way out. \u201cWith Trump (preferably) or without him, we have no choice,\u201d Rhodes wrote in a chat, according to court papers. He added: \u201cBe prepared for a major let down on the 6-8th. And get ready to do it OURSELVES.\u201d ____ Richer reported from Boston.

    "Jimmy Carter to celebrate 98 with family, friends, baseball": [
        "By BILL BARROWOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter, alreadythe longest-living U.S. president in history, will celebrate his 98th birthday Saturday with family and friends in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife, 95-year-old Rosalynn, were born in the years between World War I and the Great Depression. The 39th president\u2019s latest milestone comes asThe Carter Center, which the Carters established together after their one White House term, marks 40 years of promoting democracy and conflict resolution, monitoring elections, and advancing public health in the developing world. Jason Carter, the former president\u2019s grandson now leading the Carter Center board, described his grandfather, an outspoken Christian, as content with his life and legacy. \u201cHe is looking at his 98th birthday with faith in God\u2019s plan for him,\u201d the younger Carter, 47, said, \u201cand that\u2019s just a beautiful blessing for all of us to know, personally, that he is at peace and happy with where he has been and where he\u2019s going.\u201d Carter Center leaders said the former president, whosurvived a cancer diagnosis in 2015and aserious fall at home in 2019, already has enjoyed reading congratulatory messages sent by well-wishers around the world via social media and the center\u2019s website. But Jason Carter said his grandfather is mostly looking forward to a simple day that includes watching his favorite Major League Baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, on television. \u201cHe\u2019s still 100% with it, even though daily life things are a lot harder now,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201cBut one thing I guarantee. He will watch all the Braves games this weekend.\u201d James Earl Carter Jr. won the 1976 presidential election after beginning the campaign as a little-known one-term Georgia governor. His surprise performance in the Iowa caucuses established the small, Midwestern state as an epicenter of presidential politics. Carter went on to defeat President Gerald Ford in the general election, largely on the strength of sweeping the South before his native region shifted heavily to Republicans. A Naval Academy alumnus, Navy officer and peanut farmer, Carter won in no small part because of his promise never to lie to an electorate weary over the Vietnam War and theWatergate scandal that resulted in Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation from the presidency in 1974.Four years later, unable to tame inflation andsalve voter anger over American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost 44 states to Ronald Reagan. He returned home to Georgia in 1981 at the age of 56. The former first couple almost immediately began planning The Carter Center. It opened in Atlanta in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind effort for a former president. The stated mission: to advance peace, human rights and public health causes around the world.Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled internationally into his 80s and 90s, and he did not retire officially from the board until 2020. Since opening, the center has monitored elections in 113 countries, saidCEO Paige Alexander, and Carter has acted individually as a mediator in many countries, as well. Carter Center effortshave nearly eradicated the guinea worm, a parasite spread through unclean drinking water and painful to humans. Rosalynn Carter has steered programs designed to reduce stigma attached to mental health conditions. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying his retirement,\u201d said Alexander, who assumed her role in 2020, about the time Jason Carter took over for his grandfather. But \u201che spends a lot of time thinking about the projects that he started and the projects that we\u2019re continuing.\u201d Alexander cited the guinea worm eradication effort as a highlight. Carter set the goal in 1986, when there were about 3.5 million cases annually across 21 countries, with a concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. So far this year, Alexander said, there are six known cases in two countries. In 2019, Carter used his final annual message at the center to lament that his post-presidency had been largely silent on climate change. Jason Carter said the center\u2019s leadership is still exploring ways to combat the climate crisis. But he offered no timetable. \u201cWe won\u2019t duplicate other effective efforts,\u201d Carter said, explaining that one of the center\u2019s strategic principles is to prioritize causes and places that no other advocacy organizations have engaged. On elections and democracy, perhaps the most unpredictable turn is that Jimmy Carter has lived to see the center turn its efforts to the home front. Thecenter now has programs to combat mistrust in the democratic process in the United States. Carter Center personnel monitored Georgia\u2019s recount of U.S. presidential ballots in the state in 2020 afterthen-President Donald Trump argued the outcome was rigged. Multiple recounts in Georgia and other states affirmed the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cCertainly, we never thought we would end up coming home to do democracy and conflict resolution around our elections,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201c(But) we couldn\u2019t go be this incredible democracy and human rights organization overseas without ensuring that we were adding our voice and our expertise ... in the U.S.\u201d Ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the center has asked candidates -- regardless of party -- to sign onto a set of fair election principles, including committing to the peaceful transfer of power. Among those who have signed commitments: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Carter himself has mostly retreated from politics. For years after his 1980 defeat, Democrats steered clear of him. He enjoyed a resurgence in recent election cycles, drawing visits from several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and, in 2021, from President Joe Biden, who in 1976 was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter\u2019s presidential bid. With inflation now at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s, some Republicans are bringing up Carter again as an attack line on Biden and Democrats. Jason Carter said the former president reads and watches the news daily, and sometimes accepts calls or visits from political figures. But, he added, the former president isn\u2019t expected to appear publicly to endorse any candidates ahead of November. \u201cHis people that he feels sort of the closest connection with now are the folks in Plains, at his church and other places,\u201d Jason Carter said. \u201cBut, you know, his partner No. 1, 2 and 3 is my grandma, right? He has outlived friends and so many of his advisers and the people that he accomplished so much with in the past, but they\u2019ve never been lonely because they\u2019ve always had each other.\u201d \u2014- Online: https://bit.ly/Happy98PresidentCarter \u2014- Associated Press journalist Alex Sanz contributed to this report.",

    "Michigan women fight to preserve abortion, 1 chat at a time": [
        "By SARA BURNETTOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " UTICA, Mich. (AP) \u2014 At a wine bar in suburban Detroit, about a dozen women strategized about how to preserve theright to abortionin their state. This was not a typical political event; there were no microphones, no literature to hand out and few who would consider themselves activists. Among them was a mother of four whose only previous political experience was pushing for later school start times, a busy medical student and a retired teacher who, at 75, has never felt comfortable knocking on doors or cold calling for a candidate. \u201cBut I feel strongly about abortion,\u201d said Mary Ann Messano-Gadula. \u201cWomen should be able to take care of their own bodies.\u201d Messano-Gadula, who attended the late September \u201cVino the Vote\u201d event with two friends, described herself as the most shy of the bunch. But she said she planned to do what organizers asked of attendees \u2014 post some Facebook messages and text some friends to try to get them to support an amendment to the state constitution guaranteeing abortion rights. \u201cI\u2019m going to give it a shot,\u201d she said. Across Michigan this year, similar, more intimate events are playing out alongside the larger, traditional get-out-the-vote efforts, with major stakes for both abortion rights and the candidates \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 who support them. Michigan is one of a handful of places where abortion rights will be on the ballot in November, after theU.S. Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade in June and left the issue to states to decide. A ban approved in 1931 was suspended, thenstruck down by state courtrulings, but it is no guarantee that the procedure won\u2019t one day be outlawed. That has mobilized people in Michigan, as it has done in previous elections this cycle,including in Kansasand New York. And it could have major implications beyond the state. Michigan is one of the country\u2019s most competitive presidential battlegrounds. It was also among the states where former President Donald Trump and his allies tried to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, falsely claiming the election was stolen. Voters this fall also will decide statewide offices, including governor and secretary of state, who will be in place for the 2024 election. The race for governor already has centered around abortion. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmerfiled a lawsuitprior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling seeking to overturn the 1931 ban and said she \u201cwill continue using every tool in my toolbox to fight like hell for women and health care providers.\u201d RepublicanTudor Dixon, who opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother, has criticized Whitmer for supporting abortion without limits, and suggested voters who support the constitutional amendment could vote in favor of it and still support her campaign for governor. The issue already has generated intense interest among voters and pushback from Republicans and abortion opponents. Reproductive Freedom for All, the coalition supporting the abortion-rights amendment,collected over 750,000 signatureson petitions to put the question on the ballot \u2014 more than any other ballot initiative in Michigan history. Opponents turned out in force for a meeting of the Board of State Canvassers, the once-staid panel that decides what questions and candidates qualify for the ballot. With anti-abortion protesters outside the building audible inside the hearing room, the board split along party lines, with two Republicans voting no and two Democrats voting yes. That meant the measuredidn\u2019t qualify for the ballot, but Reproductive Freedom for All appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, where justices \u2014 a majority of whom were appointed by Democrats \u2014ordered it be put on. Red, Wine & Blue, the organization that held the wine bar gathering, is among the members of the RFFA coalition in Michigan. Their strategy is to ask suburban women \u2014 a key swing demographic in recent elections \u2014 to reach out to and talk with friends, family members and other acquaintances and ask them to vote. The model, known as relational organizing, was used successfully by candidates such as Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, whowon a runoff election to help Democrats win control of the U.S. Senate, and Pete Buttigieg, who went from little-known mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top candidate for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Greta Carnes, who led the effort for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, said it is particularly effective in turning out suburban women and on the often sensitive and personal issue of abortion. The approach is also more efficient and effective, because people can contact dozens of people in a matter of minutes via text, and a voter receiving a message from someone they know is more likely to read and consider, rather than delete it. \u201cEspecially on an issue like abortion, we can\u2019t just have activists\u201d knocking on doors, Carnes said. Lakshmi Vadlamudi, a medical student from Franklin, Michigan, saw firsthand the power of using her personal network when she helped gather signatures to put the abortion question on the ballot this summer. She told a few friends she would be in a parking lot one day collecting signatures, and word spread like wildfire, she said. Vadlamudi started getting text messages from people wanting her to come to their house so they could sign. Her Indian \u201caunties\u201d \u2014 women with whom she is close but not related \u2014 wanted to circulate their own petitions. Some had family members in the medical profession and feared legal repercussions of performing an abortion if the 1931 ban takes effect, while others worried for their daughters or granddaughters. They ended up with 20 filled petitions. \u201cWe got as many as we could get our hands on,\u201d Vadlamudi recalled. \u201cPeople kept asking,\u201d she said, and interest in the issue hasn\u2019t stopped. Red, Wine & Blue\u2019s Michigan group is aiming to reach 157,000 voters in the state through these \u201crelational\u201d contacts, according to Katie Paris, the organization\u2019s national director. The group\u2019s leader in Michigan, Kelly Dillaha, said they are recruiting 5,000 women to contact their networks and report back to the group on their progress via an app. Kathy Nitz, a mother of four from Rochester Hills, started working with Red, Wine & Blue after volunteering at her kids\u2019 schools, leading the PTA and spearheading an effort to start schools later in the morning. Those issues always felt like \u201csafe\u201d topics, she said. Talking about abortion, on the other hand, was a bit like saying the word \u201cVoldemort\u201d \u2014 the name that characters in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books fear would bring great danger if uttered. But Nitz has grown more comfortable with the topic, even discussing the nuances with her very Catholic and anti-abortion mother. And she believes these small conversations among women like herself could add up. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve come to realize as a suburban woman and mother myself is that we\u2019re undervalued. We are underappreciated and under estimated, but we\u2019re also strong,\u201d Nitz said. \u201cWe build communities, we make networks. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done.\u201d ___ Associated Press reporters Aaron Kessler in Washington and Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report. ___ For AP\u2019s full coverage of abortion, go to https://apnews.com/hub/abortion Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Shying from Trump, ex-Maine Gov. Paul LePage seeks job back": [
        "By DAVID SHARPOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " YARMOUTH, Maine (AP) \u2014 Whenthen-Maine Gov. Paul LePageendorsed Donald Trump in 2016, he credited himself as a prototype for the insurgent presidential candidate. \u201cI was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular, so I think I should support him since we are one of the same cloth,\u201d said LePage, whose two terms in office were punctuated by brash behavior and frequently offensive comments. Now, asLePage is running for a third termafter a brief retirement to Florida, he rarely talks about Trump in public, and his advisers say LePage\u2019s hiatus from politics changed him. He\u2019s eager to show he\u2019s smoothed over some of his own rough edges, though flashes of his fiery personality broke through recently at an event at a riverfront boatyard in Yarmouth, where he pledged to take on Democratic \u201celitists.\u201d \u201cI came from the streets. I was a fighter all my life,\u201d LePage told workers. \u201cI had to scrimp and save to eat and survive. I am a fighter.\u201d As LePage seeks to unseatDemocratic Gov. Janet Millsand become the longest-serving governor in Maine history, he is banking on an approach familiar to other Republican candidates in liberal- and moderate-leaning states who are trying not to alienate swing voters they would need to win a general election. LePage\u2019s efforts at putting distancing from Trump are particularly notable given LePage once invited comparisons to Trump \u2014 and made them himself. Democrats aren\u2019t going to let voters forget LePage\u2019stumultuous time in office, when he occasionally acted and sounded a lot like Trump. LePage attracted national headlines when he told the Portland chapter of the NAACP to \u201ckiss my butt,\u201d made racist remarks about drug dealers who impregnate \u201cwhite\u201d girls and accused a lawmaker of screwing over state taxpayers \u201cwithout providing Vaseline.\u201d His critics point to a recent campaign event in which LePage threatened to \u201cdeck\u201d a Democratic staffer who got too close to him \u2014 an incident, they say, that illustrates LePage hasn\u2019t changed at all. The race is shaping up to be among a dozen or so competitive contests for governor this election year. The way in which the campaign plays out with voters weary of political ugliness may be a harbinger for Trump\u2019s White House aspirations in 2024. LePage and Mills\u2019 adversarial relationship goes back years. Mills, a 74-year-old moderate and the first woman elected governor of Maine, is a former two-term attorney general whose stint as the state\u2019s top prosecutor coincided with LePage\u2019s time as governor. The two clashed publicly, with Mills declining to represent LePage\u2019s administration on some matters, forcing LePageto seek outside counsel to represent his interests in litigation. Her supporters portray her as a steady leader whose cautious COVID-19 policies helped guide the state through the worst pandemic in a century, with fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than most others. She expanded Medicaid \u2014 something LePage had blocked \u2014 and presided over the largest budget surplus in Maine history, which allowed the state tosend $850 relief checks to most residents. Raised in poverty and homeless for a time as a boy, LePage, 73, is an unabashed conservative whose past controversies often overshadowed his political achievements, such as lowering the tax burden, shrinking welfare rolls, overhauling the pension system and paying back millions of dollars of hospital debt. He attacked Mills\u2019 executive orders during the pandemic, including mandatory vaccines for health care workers, calling it a \u201creign of terror.\u201d He\u2019s called for a parental bill of rights in education, claimed Mill has allowed crime and drugs to proliferate and accused her of budgetary gimmicks that will cause problems in the future. He has promised to try again to eliminate the state\u2019s income tax. When LePage left office in 2019, prevented from seeking a third consecutive term by the Maine Constitution, he declared he was decamping for Florida, where the taxes were lower, and leaving politics behind. He didn\u2019t stay away long. Soon, he was headed back to Maine for what supporters described as \u201cLePage 2.0.\u201d LePage\u2019s senior adviser Brent Littlefield said LePage was astounded when Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and that LePage fears the country is in danger of tearing itself apart. LePage issued a statement amid the violence supporting law enforcement and telling those involved in the riot \u201cto leave and go home.\u201d LePage served as Trump\u2019s honorary state chairman and once sought a job in his administration, but he now won\u2019t say whether he would vote for Trump for president if Trump runs again in 2024. Despite any private misgivings, however, LePage hasn\u2019t condemned Trump. He declined an Associated Press interview request. The former governor made no reference to Trump while touring Yankee Marina & Boatyard, even though Trump remains popular in rural Maine, where he twice won an electoral vote while losing the statewide vote. Boatyard president Deborah Delp said LePage is needed at a time when her workers are suffering from high inflation and worried about the future. She said she can \u201chandle some rough language\u201d from LePage if he puts the economy on track. \u201cPoliticians are politicians. And he\u2019s not a politician. He\u2019s a businessman. He says what he thinks,\u201d Delp said. Maria Testa, a Democrat from Portland, disagrees. \u201cHe\u2019s bombastic and has a cruel temper. He\u2019s such a big no for me,\u201d Testa said. While campaigning, LePage largely tries to steer clear of Trump\u2019s lies of a rigged 2020 election. LePage acknowledges that Biden is president but declines to address whether he thinks the election was legitimate. LePage also avoids the issue of abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Mills has pledged to fight to ensure women continue to have a right to a legal abortion in Maine. A third candidate for governor, independent Sam Hunkler, isn\u2019t expected to play much of a role in the race, unlike deep-pocketed independent Eliot Cutler, who did in 2010 and 2014, when LePage won each election without a majority. Maine\u2019s ranked-choice votingsystem won\u2019t be a factor. It is used in federal congressional races but not in the governor\u2019s contest because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution. Betsy Martin, a retired health care administrator from Biddeford, said residents are feeling drained by the corrosive partisanship in a rural state with a tradition of moderate politics and independent voters. Some are tuning out altogether, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re exhausted. They\u2019re extremely fatigued. We\u2019re worn out,\u201d she said. ___ Follow David Sharp on Twitter @David_Sharp_AP ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Supreme Court\u2019s top cases for new term, new Justice Jackson": [
        "By The Associated PressOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday, hearing arguments for the first time after a summer break and with new Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Already the court has said it will decide cases on a range of major issues including affirmative action, voting rights and the rights of LGBTQ people. The justices will add more cases to their docket in coming months. A look at some of the cases the court has already agreed to hear. The justices are expected to decide each of the cases before taking a summer break at the end of June: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION In cases from Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, the court couldend any consideration of race in college admissions. If this seems familiar, it\u2019s because the high court has been asked repeatedly over the past 20 years to end affirmative action in higher education. In previous cases from Michigan and Texas, the court reaffirmed the validity of considering college applicants\u2019 race among many factors. But this court is more conservative than those were. ___ VOTING RIGHTS The courtcould further reduce protections for minority votersin its third major consideration in 10 years of the landmark Voting Rights Act, which was enacted to combat enduring racial discrimination in voting. The case the justices are hearing involves Alabama, where just one of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts has a Black majority. That\u2019s even though 27% of the state\u2019s residents are Black. A three-judge panel that included two appointees of President Donald Trump agreed that the state should have to create a second district with a Black majority, but the Supreme Court stopped any changes and said it would hear the case. A ruling for the state could wipe away all but the most obvious cases of intentional discrimination on the basis of race. ___ ELECTIONS Republicans are asking the justices to embrace a novel legal concept that would limitstate courts\u2019 oversight of elections for Congress. North Carolina\u2019s top court threw out the state\u2019s congressional map that gave Republicans a lopsided advantage in a closely divided state and eventually came up with a map that basically evenly divided the state\u2019s 14 congressional districts between Democrats and Republicans. The state GOP argues that state courts have no role to play in congressional elections, including redistricting, because the U.S. Constitution gives that power to state legislatures alone. Four conservative justices have expressed varying levels of openness to the \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d theory. ___ CLEAN WATER This is yet another case in which the court is being asked to discard an earlier ruling andloosen the regulation of property under the nation\u2019s chief law to combat water pollution. The case involves an Idaho couple who won an earlier high court round in their bid to build a house on property near a lake without getting a permit under the Clean Water Act. The outcome could change the rules for millions of acres of property that contain wetlands. ___ IMMIGRATION The Biden administration is back at the Supreme Court to argue for achange in immigration policyfrom the Trump administration. It\u2019s is appealing a ruling against a Biden policy prioritizing deportation of people in the country illegally who pose the greatest public safety risk. Last term, the justices by a 5-4 vote paved the way for the administration to end the Trump policy that required asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their court hearing. In July, also by a 5-4 vote, the high court refused to allow the administration to implement policy guidance for deportations. A Trump-era policy favored deporting people in the country illegally regardless of criminal history or community ties. ___ LGBTQ RIGHTS A new clash involvingreligion, free speech and the rights of LGBTQ peoplewill also be before the justices. The case involves Colorado graphic and website designer Lorie Smith who wants to expand her business and offer wedding website services. She says her Christian beliefs would lead her to decline any request from a same-sex couple to design a wedding website, however, and that puts her in conflict with a Colorado anti-discrimination law. The case is a new chance for the justices to confront issues the court skirted five years ago in a case about a baker objected to making cakes for same-sex weddings. The court has grown more conservative since that time. ___ NATIVE AMERICAN ADOPTION In November, the court will review afederal law that gives Native Americans preference in adoptions of Native children. The case presents the most significant legal challenges to the Indian Child Welfare Act since its 1978 passage. The law has long been championed by Native American leaders as a means of preserving their families and culture. A federal appeals court in April upheld the law and Congress\u2019 authority to enact it. But the judges also found some of the law\u2019s provisions unconstitutional, including preferences for placing Native American children with Native adoptive families and in Native foster homes. ___ BACON LAW BACKLASH Also on the menu for the justices: aCalifornia animal rights law. The case stems from a 2018 ballot measure where California voters barred the sale of pork in the state if the pig it came from or the pig\u2019s mother was raised in confined conditions preventing them from laying down or turning around. Two agricultural associations challenging the law say almost no farms satisfy those conditions. They say the \u201cmassive costs of complying\u201d with the law will \u201cfall almost exclusively on out-of-state farmers\u201d and that the costs will be passed on to consumers nationwide. ___ ART WORLD The court\u2019s resolution of adispute involving pieces by artist Andy Warholcould have big consequences in the art world and beyond. If the Warhol side loses a copyright dispute involving an image Warhol made of the musician Prince, other artworks could be in peril, lawyers say. But the other side says if Warhol wins, it would be a license for other artists to blatantly copy. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court",

    "Biden signs bill to avert government shutdown, aid Ukraine": [
        "By KEVIN FREKINGOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden signed into law Friday a bill that finances the federal government through mid-December and provides another infusion ofmilitary and economic aid to Ukraineafter lawmakers acted to avert a partial government shutdown set to begin after midnight. The bill passed the House by a vote of 230-201 earlier in the day. Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the measure. Some wanted to extend government funding into January when, based on the results of the midterm elections, it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll have more leverage over setting federal spending for the full fiscal year. Others argued the measure needed to do more to address border security. Democrats said passing the bill was important to helping Ukraine as well as victims of recent natural disasters in the U.S.,including Hurricane Ian, as it provides a Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster fund with a year\u2019s worth of money up front rather than for two-and-a-half months. \u201cTurn on the news. Lookwhat\u2019s happening in Floridaright now. Look atwhat happened to Puerto Rico. Look atwhat\u2019s happening in Alaska. I mean, people need help,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. \u201cAnd look at what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. Do we support helping preserve democracy in Ukraine or not? That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d But Republicans complained the bill brought to the floor was not subject to bipartisan negotiations in the House and didn\u2019t reflect their priorities. \u201cWe know we have a crisis on the southern border. You can turn on the television every night. You can look at the fentanyl pouring into the country, You can see the tragedy of human trafficking. Is there anything in this bill that asks us to do anything different, anything new?\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \u201cNo, you just ask, \u2019please allow us to continue thecurrent state of affairs on the southern border.\u2032 That is a travesty.\u201d In the end, support for the bill was unanimous among Democratic lawmakers. Only 10 Republican lawmakers joined them in voting yes. Later Friday, former President Donald Trump responded to the bill\u2019s passage with a racist message on his social media platform attacking Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and his Asian American wife, who also served in Trump\u2019s administration as a Cabinet secretary. Trump ominously wrote that McConnell has a \u201cdeath wish.\u201d The bill finances the federal government through Dec. 16 and buys lawmakers more time to agree on legislation setting spending levels for the 2023 fiscal year. The bill generally keeps spending at current levels, though it does provide more than $12.3 billion in Ukraine-related aid. The money will go to provide training, equipment and logistics support for the Ukraine military, help Ukraine\u2019s government provide basic services to its citizens and replenish U.S. weapons systems and munitions. \u201cThis contribution ensures we continue upholding our moral responsibility to support the people of Ukraine in the face of a vicious invasion that continues to demand decisive action by us,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the Democratic chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Disaster assistance was also attached to the stopgap bill, including $2.5 billion to helpNew Mexico communities recover from the Hermit\u2019s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, the largest wildfire in the state\u2019s history; $2 billion for a block grant program that aids the economic recovery of communities impacted by recent disasters; and$20 million for water and wastewater infrastructure improvements previously authorized for Jackson, Mississippi. \u201cWe cannot leave communities behind that are still picking up the pieces from disastrous floods, wildfires and hurricane, and even basic water system failures,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. The bill would provide an additional $1 billion for a program that helps low-income households heat their homes. And it would transfer $3 billion from a Pentagon aid program to the State Department forcontinued Afghan resettlement operations. Lawmakers also included a reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s user fee agreements for five years, which ensures the agency can continue critical product safety reviews and won\u2019t need to issue pink slips for thousands of employees working on drug and medical device applications. One thing missing from the bill is the billions of dollars in additional funding that Biden sought toaid the response to COVID-19 and monkeypox. Republicans criticized the health spending as unnecessary. The White House said the money would have been used to accelerate the research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, prepare for future COVID variants and support the global response.",

    "DeSantis drops provocations \u2014 for now \u2014 in response to Ian": [
        "By SARA BURNETTSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " Florida Gov.Ron DeSantishas whipsawed his way through the national conversation this month, first by puttingmigrantson planes or buses to Democratic strongholds and then shifting to a more traditional role of crisis manager as one of thestrongest hurricanesto ever hit the U.S. barreled into his state. Facing areelection in Novemberthat could be a precursor to a presidential campaign, the approach has been awkward at points. Navigating one of his state\u2019s darkest moments, DeSantis, a Republican, must partner with a Democratic president he has spent the better part of two years demeaning. He\u2019s also gladly accepting the type of federal disaster aid and assistance he rejected as wasteful while he was a member of Congress. But together, the developments over the past two weeks offer insight into how DeSantis might govern if he wins another term as governor or advances in a 2024 presidential contest. He\u2019s willing to use \u2014 and potentially exceed \u2014 the raw executive power of his office to pick at America\u2019s most sensitive divides on issues like immigration. In a sudden moment of disaster, however, he\u2019s capable of striking a more unifying tone in a way that former President Donald Trump \u2014once a close ally and now a potential 2024 rival\u2014 rarely demonstrated. \u201cAt the end of the day, I view this as something that you\u2019ve got folks that are in need, and local, federal and state, we have a need to work together,\u201d DeSantis said at a briefing late Thursday, taking a far more conciliatory tone toward an administration he bitterly criticized just days earlier. He expressed appreciation that FEMA has approved every request for aid he has made, and said he welcomed the agency\u2019s director to travel with him to view destruction. The shift in tone is almost certainly temporary. When a 12-story condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last year and killed 98 people, DeSantis appeared with local officials, including Democratswho praised his assistance. He sat next toPresident Joe Bidenduring a briefing with first responders and local officials in Miami. Within months, however,he returned to partisan brawls. Facing another tragedy, DeSantis didn\u2019t answer questions this week about whether he would meet with Biden, saying he wasn\u2019t sure about the president\u2019s travel plans. At a FEMA briefing on Thursday, Biden also aimed to set aside hostilities, saying he would visit Florida when conditions allow and meet with DeSantis \u201cif he wants to meet.\u201d Biden and DeSantis both said they have spoken more than once. And at DeSantis\u2019 request, Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in parts of Florida, freeing up additional federal assistance to state and local governments and individuals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build it back with the state and local government,\u201d Biden said. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierretweetedthat Biden and DeSantis spoke again by phone on Friday, as the FEMA administrator is on the ground in Florida. DeSantis\u2019 embrace of federal help is a shift from his early days as a congressman,when he voted against a federal relief package for New York and New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy.That drew criticism this week from some New York-area officials and other Democrats who described the turnaround as a move from cruel to hypocritical. Richard Conley, a University of Florida political science professor, said DeSantis is doing what he needs to do, pragmatically and politically. While DeSantis is popular in the reliably Republican area of southwest Florida that was hardest hit by Hurricane Ian, he said people will inevitably become frustrated if it takes too long to get help, and will look for someone to blame. \u201cHe\u2019s just got to get the job done,\u201d said Conley. \u201cThe question will be: Going forward, does he look very statesmanlike? Does this help him with an eventual 2024 run? I don\u2019t know, it remains to be seen.\u201d Since his early years running for governor, DeSantis has been linked to Trump. DeSantis was a relatively obscure third-term congressman when he announced his 2018 bid for governor \u2014 and a Trump endorsement \u2014 on Fox News. He echoed some of Trump\u2019s favorite lines as he campaigned, pledging, for example, to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Tallahassee. Trump took credit for the victory, though their relationship is said to have chilled amid the 2024 talk. As governor, DeSantis has elevated issues that excite the conservative base and used his resources and the power of his office to get things done his way, even if it pushed the limits of his legal authority. During the COVID pandemic,DeSantis insisted Florida would remain open. He shunned guidance from federal health expertsand once said of Dr. Anthony Fauci that someone should \u201cchuck him across the Potomac.\u201d He also stripped funding from school districts that implemented mask mandates. This spring, DeSantis signed legislationstripping Disney of a special agreement that allowed the theme park to govern itself, after the company criticized a new state lawthat critics called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d DeSantis also suspendedan elected Democratic prosecutorin Tampa from office over statements about not pursuing criminal charges in abortion, transgender rights and certain low-level cases. The prosecutor has since filed a federal free speech lawsuit against the governor. In recent weeks, Florida under DeSantis\u2019 direction paid fortwo flights of migrants from Texas to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. DeSantis was the latest GOP governor, frustrated over the federal government\u2019s response to policing the southern border, to transport the migrants to Democratic cities. DeSantis defended the move as a way to make immigration a \u201cfront-burner issue\u201d ahead of the midterms. Critics questioned the legality, and his Democratic opponent for governor said it represented a new low level of shrewdness. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me what he\u2019s willing to do for sheer political gain,\u201d Charlie Crist, his gubernatorial challenger, said. Conley, who wrote a book about Trump and populism, said he understands the comparisons between the two men, both often provocative Republicans. But he noted key differences, including that DeSantis is more disciplined and restrained with statements on social media. \u201cHe may say controversial things, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to sit around at 3 or 4 in the morning and contemplate how to get back at (Senate GOP Leader) Mitch McConnell or something\u201d as Trump would do, Conley said. Trump also drew criticism for his responses to natural disasters, which often failed to convey empathy. After Puerto Rico was flattened by Hurricane Maria,he flew to San Juan and threw paper towels into the crowd,withheld aidand questioned whether a death toll in the thousands was contrived by Democrats to make him look bad. On a trip to Houston after Hurricane Harvey, he was criticized for not meeting with storm victims. When he returned days later, Trump urged those at a shelter to \u201chave a good time.\u201d Natural disasters have historically put U.S. politicians in predicaments. Years earlier, President George W. Bush left the impression of overlooking Hurricane Karina\u2019s devastation in New Orleans when he flew over the city while returning to Washington from vacation. He later praised FEMA Director Michael Brown as doing \u201ca heck of a job.\u201d Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and Democratic President Barack Obama felt political effects of a friendly greeting after Hurricane Sandy. The image may have helped Obama project a moderate, bipartisan front days before his election for a second term but conservatives derided Christie for what they called a \u201chug.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s afternoon briefing, DeSantis spoke of surveying the damage, from a wiped out causeway between the mainland and Sanibel Island off Fort Myers to destroyed homes and hundreds of people rescued. \u201cThese are resilient folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will bounce back, but we just want to make sure that we can kind of pave the way for them.\u201d",

    "NIH to fund unproven ALS drugs under patient-backed law": [
        "By MATTHEW PERRONEOctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When patients with a deadly diagnosis and few treatment options have tried to get unapproved, experimental drugs, they have long faced a dilemma: Who will pay? Responsibility for funding so-called compassionate use has always fallen to drugmakers, though many are unwilling or unable to make their drugs available for free to dying patients. After years of lobbying Congress, patients with the debilitating illness known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease have found an unprecedented solution: make the federal government pay. Under a recent law, the National Institutes of Health will begin spending about $25 million to enroll patients in compassionate use \u2014 also called open access \u2014 programs of unapproved drugs. The first step, announced Friday, will give patients access to a sugar-based injection called trehalose, that is thought to help nerve cells clear toxic proteins. Only patients who can\u2019t get into conventional drug trials are eligible for the program. And their progress must be tracked to gather data about the treatment and their underlying disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The initiative blurs the line between treatment and research, and it puts the NIH in the position of paying for unapproved drugs in studies that may yield limited data. While it offers a critical new option for ALS patients, it also raises the possibility that limited federal dollars could eventually be tapped for more unproven treatments in other diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t typically expect the government to pay for things until we know they work,\u201d said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist. \u201cBut the system we have in this country relies on drug companies to develop our drugs, and private companies are not in the business of providing their products for free.\u201d Fernandez Lynch and many other experts support the new approach as an innovative solution to the challenges facing ALS patients, who typically survive three to five years after initial symptoms. The disease destroys nerve cells needed to walk, talk and \u2014 eventually \u2014 breathe. Up to 90% of ALS patients are ineligible for traditional clinical trials, according to researchers, typically because their disease has progressed too far to show major treatment benefits. Even eligible patients must compete for access. One recent analysis counted 2,000 trial openings in the U.S. for 25,000 people living with ALS. Patients aren\u2019t the only beneficiaries of the NIH program. The government funding essentially replaces costs previously borne by drugmakers. One long-time patient advocate sees a troubling precedent in that financial shift. \u201cMy sense is that it\u2019s the companies\u2019 responsibility, not the taxpayers\u2019, to pick up the cost for expanded access programs,\u201d said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University researcher who has informally advised ALS patients on expanded access. \u201cBut the companies have stonewalled patients for years, so as a last resort they went to Congress.\u201d During the 1980s and 1990s, Gonsalves and other HIV activists were instrumental in pushing drugmakers to provide early access to experimental medications. ALS patients say most companies in their field are tiny startups that can\u2019t afford such costs. Drugmakers have other reasons to deny access, including concerns that unexpected safety problems could hurt their approval chances. The NIH spends the vast majority of its $45 billion budget on early-stage research focused on identifying the root causes, treatments and potential cures for diseases. Tracking drug safety is one key aspect of the new program, along with various biological measures of ALS. But the initiative is unlikely to detect whether the drugs are actually working, because patients won\u2019t be compared to a placebo group, the gold-standard approach to medical research. \u201cUnless the drug is a miracle drug, it\u2019s unlikely you would see efficacy in this type of research,\u201d said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The initiative is part of broader legislation pushed through Congress last year by patient advocates, including I AM ALS, a nonprofit co-founded by two former Obama White House staffers. \u201cI\u2019m five years in so I can\u2019t qualify for any clinical trials,\u201d said Brian Wallach, who launched I AM ALS with his wife after being diagnosed in 2017. \u201cI hope to be eligible for the expanded access pathway.\u201d He describes NIH\u2019s new program as a \u201cpilot\u201d that will be reviewed by federal inspectors, as required by the new law. Wallach spent several years working on the legislation with congressional staffers. It passed the House last year by a 423-3 vote, a rare display of bipartisanship that also underscored the group\u2019s political clout. The far-reaching bill requires the Food and Drug Administration to develop a plan to accelerate drug development and form new partnerships to study neurodegenerative diseases. The legislation grew out of patients\u2019 deep frustration with access to experimental therapies, including a stem cell treatment from the tiny drugmaker Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics. After the company\u2019s 200-patient study failed to show positive results in 2020, Brainstorm allowed a handful of patients to continue receiving injections under expanded access. But company executives said a larger program was infeasible, given that Brainstorm has no revenue. \u201cWe used millions of dollars for our small expanded access program,\u201d said Mary Kay Turner, a company executive. \u201cSo we did the maximum we could, but it was just a tiny sliver.\u201d Brainstorm plans to submit its drug for FDA approval, despite a rare public statement from the agency last year that company data \u201cdo not support the proposed clinical benefit.\u201d That followed thousands of calls and messages to the agency from ALS patients. While many treatments may prove ineffective, Dr. Richard Bedlack of Duke University says getting patients into expanded access programs is still preferable to the current situation, in which they often seek out untested remedies on their own. \u201cHistorically their only option was to go on the internet and try to buy these supplements or alternative therapies,\u201d said Bedlack, who consults for several drugmakers. It remains to be seen how many patients the NIH will enroll under its $25 million grant. The original law called for $100 million in funding over four years. House lawmakers have budgeted $80 million in spending bills for the next fiscal year, though those have not yet passed the Senate. For now, NIH\u2019s Koroshetz notes that the expanded access studies will be more expensive than other NIH trials because the government is bearing the cost of making and distributing the drugs. He conceded: \u201cIt\u2019s a little different from our usual grants, where we don\u2019t pay the companies at all for the drug.\u201d ___ Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter:@AP_FDAwriter ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

    "Uvalde shooting, border dominate only Texas governor debate": [
        "By PAUL J. WEBEROctober 1, 2022 GMT",
        " EDINBURG, Texas (AP) \u2014Republican Gov. Greg Abbottsaid Friday night that Texas would send busloads of migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border to more cities and Democrat challengerBeto O\u2019Rourkepledged tighter gun laws as parents whose children were killed in the Uvalde school shooting stood outside an auditorium hosting the only debate before November\u2019s election. The promises reflected how Abbott and O\u2019Rourke are eager to spotlight starkly different issues with just three weeks before early voting begins in a competitive Texas governor\u2019s race that is one of most closely watched \u2014 and expensive \u2014 of the 2022 midterms. On abortion, which is now banned in Texas, Abbott didn\u2019t waver over signing a law that allows no exceptions for rape victims as the restrictions create stumbles for some Republicans who have been wary of voter backlash. But Abbott was more assured while defending hisdramatic steps on the Texas borderthat are the centerpiece of his campaign for a third term. Sharing a stage with O\u2019Rourke for the first time, Abbott boasted about a $4 billion operation that has included migrant jails and buses to New York, Chicago and Washington and criticized President Joe Biden by name as much as his underdog opponent sitting across from him. He did not say where Texas would next send buses that have refocused the race on immigration but defended the destinations to some of the nation\u2019s largest Democratic-led cities as practical and not political. \u201cThere will be other cities in the future that also will be on the receiving end of migrants, because we will continue to have to move migrants because Joe Biden continues to allow more illegal immigrants to come into the state of Texas,\u201d Abbott said. O\u2019Rourke called the mission a failure and attacked Abbott over the number of migrant crossings remaining high despite the governor\u2019s escalating mission over the past year. \u201cWe are eight years into his time as governor, and this is what we have on our border,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. The debate had no live audience, but outside the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, parents of some of the 19 children killed in the Robb Elementary School massacre stood in support of O\u2019Rourke after lashing Abbott over his rejection of new gun laws. The presence of five Uvalde families in Edinburg, a border region that has emerged as a central backdrop for November\u2019s midterm elections, underscored the sustained anger over one of America\u2019s deadliest classroom shootings. Polls show a single-digit race, butthe stakes in the debate were especially high for O\u2019Rourkein what remains an uphill climb to become the first Democrat to win statewide office in Texas in nearly 30 years. Abbott, a potential 2024 presidential contender who in eight years as governor has loosened Texas\u2019 firearm restrictions and signed a law doing away with background checks for concealed handguns, waved off calls for stricter gun controls since the Uvalde attack, which also killed two teachers. Uvalde families have put at the top of their demands raising the minimum age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle like the one used in the shooting from 18 to 21 years old. Florida raised the minimum age weeks after the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018under a law signed by then-Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Abbott has said that raising the age would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because of recent court rulings, an assessment criticized by legal experts. \u201cNo parent should lose a child and we want to do everything we can to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. We want to end school shootings,\u201d Abbott said of raising the age to purchase AR-15-style weapons. \u201c\u2019But we cannot do that by making false promises.\u201d O\u2019Rourke, who has been haunted in his campaign by his support of confiscating such weapons while running for president in 2019, did not directly answer when asked if he still supported the position. \u201cI\u2019m for making progress,\u201d he said. Like many Democrats running in November, O\u2019Rourke is drawing on outrage over abortion access and mass shootings \u2014 issues thathave energized voters elsewhere. But as Texas Democrats also know, those same issues have failed to carry them in past elections. Although no other debates between the two are planned, it will hardly be the last time that more than 17 million registered voters in Texas will see Abbott and O\u2019Rourke on television before the Nov. 8 election. Both are blitzing airwaves with attack ads in what will wind up as one of the country\u2019s most expensive races this year. Abbott stockpiled nearly $50 million before O\u2019Rourke even entered the race last year and this week launched new spots calling the Democrat a \u201ccon artist.\u201d O\u2019Rourke, who remains one of the Democrats\u2019 most prolific fundraisers after his failed runs for Senate in 2018 and president in 2020, quickly pulled in more than $30 million in the first half of the year and attacked Abbott overTexas\u2019 new abortion banin his first ads this month. ___ Associated Press writer Jake Bleiberg contributed to this report. ___ Find more AP coverage of the midterms athttps://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-electionsandhttps://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Biden uses $130M in frozen Egypt aid to help Pacific Islands": [
        "By MATTHEW LEE and AAMER MADHANISeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration will pay for $130 million in new climate initiatives for Pacific Island nations by reallocating money that had originally been earmarked for military assistance for Egypt but withheld because of concerns over human rights abuses. The State Department said it planned to reprogram money allotted for Egypt to pay for the Pacific Islands in a Sept. 29 memo to Vice President Kamala Harris and congressional leaders that was obtained by The Associated Press on Friday. President Joe Biden announced a plan Thursday for the U.S. to spend $810 million over the next decade \u2014 including $130 million for climate resilience programming \u2014 to assist the islands as he met with more than a dozen leaders from the region at the U.S.-Pacific Island Summit. The administration is looking to put greater focus on the Pacific Islands amid heightened concern about China\u2019s growing military and economic influence in the region. \u201cRecent actions by the People\u2019s of Republic of China in the Indo-Pacific have highlighted that increasing U.S. engagement and activity is an urgent priority with major impact on U.S. national interests,\u201d the State Department notification said. The money reprogrammed was a portion of $1.3 billion in foreign military financing allotted for Egypt in the 2020 budget. The administration froze $130 million in funding over Egypt\u2019s failure to improve human rights conditions. Congress has a rule that a portion of the annual funding \u2014 around $300 million \u2014 to Cairo should be conditioned on the Egyptian government upholding basic human rights conditions. But the Biden administration, like past administrations, has used its authority to issue a waiver to that rule on national security grounds and allow much of the funding to be sent to the Egyptian government. The White House deferred comment on the decision to reprogram the funding to the State Department. State officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Leaders from Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and New Caledonia attended this week\u2019s two-day summit, which included a dinner with Biden at the White House. Vanuatu and Nauru sent representatives, and Australia, New Zealand and the secretary-general of the Pacific Island Forum sent observers. The summit came amid worrying signs to the U.S. that Beijing has grown its influence in the region. Earlier this year, the Solomon Islands signed a new security pact with Beijing. The State Department pointed to concerns about Beijing\u2019s increasing sway in explaining its decision to reprogram the funding originally meant for Egypt. \u201cAs the recent signing of a new PRC-Solomon Islands security agreement demonstrates, we may be in the early stages of an historic shift in the Pacific that would usher in a new security paradigm \u2014 one that is unfavorable to U.S. security interests, will frustrate our ability to effectively compete with the PRC, and will impede implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy,\u201d the memo said.",

    "Justice Jackson says she has \u2018a seat at the table\u2019": [
        "By MARK SHERMANSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014Justice Ketanji Brown Jacksonsaid Friday she has \u201ca seat at the table now and I\u2019m ready to work,\u201d leaning into her history-making role as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. Jackson spoke at the Library of Congress several hours after she made her first appearance on the Supreme Court bench in a brief ceremony that was attended by President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses. \u201cPeople from all walks of life approach me with what I can only describe as a profound sense of pride and what feels to me like renewed ownership. I can see it in their eyes. I can hear it in their voices. They stare at me as if to say, \u2018Look at what we\u2019ve done,\u2019\u201d Jackson said in remarks that lasted 10 minutes and were frequently interrupted by applause from the invitation-only crowd. The video was livestreamed by the Library of Congress. \u201cThey\u2019re saying to me in essence, \u2018You go, girl,\u201d\u2019 the 52-year-old justice said. She said she hopes to be an inspiration to today\u2019s children and pledged to work hard through inevitable ups and downs. \u201cI have a seat at the table now. I have a seat at the table now and I\u2019m ready to work,\u201d Jackson said. Earlier, she was the center of attention at her ceremonial investiture at the Supreme Court, also open only to those with invitations. Chief Justice John Roberts wished the 52-year-old Jackson a \u201clong and happy career in our common calling,\u201d the traditional welcome for a new justice. She took her place at the far end of the bench to Roberts\u2019 left, just next to Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The justices are seated by seniority. During the ceremony Jackson also followedthe custom of every other new justice since 1972and sat in a chair that once belonged to John Marshall, who served as chief justice for 34 years in the early 1800s. Marshall also was a slaveholder, perhaps adding a special poignancy to Jackson taking her place in his onetime possession. She is only the third Black justice in the court\u2019s history, along with her new colleague Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. Friday\u2019s ceremony included the reading of the commission appointing Jackson to the court. She also repeated the oath she took whenshe formally joined the court in June, just after the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer. Breyer was among a courtroom filled with dignitaries, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Speaker Paul Ryan, a Jackson relative through marriage. Jackson\u2019s parents, daughters, brother and in-laws had front-row seats. Several wives of current and former justices also attended, including Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas. Thomas, a conservative activist, wasinterviewed Thursdayby the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and stood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent. Jackson was confirmed in April on a 53-47 vote in the Senate, with three Republican senators joining all Democrats to support her. Biden had pledged during his presidential campaign that he would nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Biden, Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff spent a few minutes with the justices before the court convened, court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said. The president said nothing during the five-minute, tightly scripted courtroom ceremony. Back at the White House, Biden tweeted in praise of Jackson\u2019s \u201cbrilliant legal mind\u201d and touted his record on filling judgeships. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve appointed 84 federal judges so far. No group of that many judges has been appointed as quickly, or been that diverse,\u201d Biden said. Jackson and Roberts walked down the 36 front steps of the court for photos following the ceremony. They chatted briefly on the court plaza, and when Roberts departed, the justice\u2019s husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, joined her. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Dr. Jackson said, as they embraced in front of a gathering of reporters and well-wishers. Jackson is the first justice appointed by a Democratic president since Justice Elena Kagan joined the court in 2010. Kagan was appointed by former President Barack Obama, who also appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. It appeared Obama would get a third high court pick whenJustice Antonin Scalia diedin February 2016. But Senate Republicans refused to take up Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland, then serving as a federal appeals court judge. Garland, now Attorney General, also participated in Friday\u2019s ceremony. Former President Donald Trump eventually chose Justice Neil Gorsuch, the first of his three Supreme Court appointees, to fill Scalia\u2019s seat. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.",

    "Biden vows Russia won\u2019t \u2018get away with\u2019 Ukraine annexation": [
        "By MATTHEW LEE, FATIMA HUSSEIN and AAMER MADHANISeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The United States and its allies hit back at Russia\u2019s annexation of four Ukrainian regions on Friday, slapping sanctions on more than 1,000 people and companies including arms supply networks as President Joe Biden warned Vladimir Putin he can\u2019t \u201cget away with\u201d seizing Ukrainian land. The Russian annexation, though expected,escalated an already heated conflict that\u2019s becomefraught with potential nuclear implications. Biden said his administration would support any effort by Ukraine to retake the annexed territories by force, setting the stage for further hostilities. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country would make an \u201caccelerated\u201d bid to join the NATO military alliance, a plan not endorsed by the U.S. or other allies that could add fuel to the fire. \u201cAmerica and its allies are not going to be intimidated by Putin and his reckless words and threats,\u201d Biden told reporters. He added that Putin \u201ccan\u2019t seize his neighbor\u2019s territory and get away with it.\u201d Russian PresidentVladimir Putin\u2019s announcementthat Russia is incorporating four Ukrainian cities and areas was not unexpected following referendums this week that the West had denounced as shams. And the U.S. and Western allies had previewed what their reaction would be. But the developments dramatically increased tensions to a point not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis 60 years ago during the Cold War. Biden had spoken out against the annexation plans last week at the U.N. General Assembly, where a vast majority of other members also voiced support for respecting the territorial integrity of all nations On Friday, he used the moment to reiterate that the U.S. and NATO allies would not allow Russia to attack any of the nearby NATO members without facing a strong military response. \u201cAmerica is fully prepared, prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory. Every single inch,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd so, Mr. Putin, don\u2019t misunderstand what I\u2019m saying. Every inch.\u201d While the Biden administration has identified the suppliers of Russia\u2019s weapons and battlefield high-tech as a priority, many of Friday\u2019s other sanctions were in line with penalties already enacted on thousands of Russian individuals and companies, and may have comparatively little impact on the war effort. The administration hopes they will serve to further undermine support for Putin\u2019s invasion among Russia\u2019s elite. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its European allies are rushing to complete agreement on a measure they hope will do more to damage Russia\u2019s economy: a cap onRussia\u2019s maritime oil exportsthat would undermine the prices Putin can demand for his country\u2019s oil globally. For now, Biden said the new U.S. financial penalties, similar to those coming from like-minded countries, will impose severe costs on people and companies \u201cthat provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\u201d The sanctions will apply to countries, people or firms that support or do business with Russia-backed authorities in the newly annexed areas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, echoing Biden, said the U.S. \u201cunequivocally rejects Russia\u2019s fraudulent attempt to change Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. ... This is a clear violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.\u201d \u201cNo one is fooled by what Moscow has done,\u201d Blinken told reporters at a joint news conference with Canada\u2019s visiting foreign minister. \u201cThe entire process around these sham referenda was a complete farce. This territory is and will remain Ukraine, and Ukraine has every right to defend its land, to defend its people and to take back the territory that Russia has seized from it.\u201d This suggests the U.S. will support the Ukrainians with weapons and ammunition to help them with military action to retake the annexed areas. The U.S. has warned Ukraine in the past not to use American weapons against Russian territory. Blinken also spoke out against Putin\u2019s nuclear threats.. \u201cThis kind of loose talk about nuclear weapons is the height of irresponsibility, and it\u2019s something that we take very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date\u201d he said, the U.S. has not seen that \u201cRussia is actually doing anything that suggests they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cI can just tell you that we plan against every possible scenario, including this one.\u201d Biden also pushed back against Putin\u2019s comments on Friday in which he accused the West of sabotaging Russia-built natural gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Nordic nations said the undersea blasts that damaged the pipelines this week and have led to huge methane leaks involved several hundred pounds of explosives. The president said the U.S. and allies are still working to determine who was responsible for the blasts, but excoriated Putin over his accusation. \u201cLet me say this, it was a deliberate act of sabotage,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies.\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that \u201cnot many\u201d countries have the ability to carry out such an attack on the pipelines. He stopped short of charging Russia was responsible but made clear the U.S. is suspicious that they may be complicit. \u201cRussia has done what it frequently does when it is responsible for something, which is make accusations that it was really someone else who did it,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this repeatedly over time.\u201d As for a broader guarantee of protection, Ukraine has sought NATO membership for years but has not yet been admitted due to concerns about its domestic governance. As a result of Russia\u2019s invasion, Finland and Sweden have applied for fast-track admission into the alliance. The White House said Sullivan had spoken with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to highlight the U.S. and NATO\u2019s \u201cfirm commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d But the Biden administration isn\u2019t embracing Zelenskyy\u2019s push for an accelerated path to NATO membership. Sullivan said the U.S. was focused on supporting Ukraine through \u201cpractical on the ground support.\u201d He added that \u201cthe process in Brussels should be taken up at a different time.\u201d Earlier, following Putin\u2019s announcement, the White House along with the State, Treasury and Commerce departments had announced the new sanctions in a series of coordinated statements. The sanctions expand on what have been escalating penalties against Russia and its proxies since the invasion began on Feb. 24. Treasury designated hundreds of members of Russia\u2019s parliament, leaders of the country\u2019s financial and military infrastructure and suppliers for sanctions designations that include asset freezes and bans on Americans doing business with them. The Commerce Department added 57 companies to its list of export control violators, and the State Department added more than 900 people to its visa ban list, making them ineligible for travel to the United States. Since the start of the invasion, the U.S. and European nations have imposed significant financial penalties on Russia, its leadership and wealthy oligarchs tied to Putin. The allies have gone after the central bank reserves that underpin the Russian economy and have severed many Russian banks from a vital global financial network called SWIFT. The war is having a devastating impact on the global economy and has contributed to massive disruptions to supplies of energy and food throughout the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this week said the global economy is set to lose $2.8 trillion in output in 2023 because of the conflict. Putin appears undeterred. He warned that Russia would never give up the absorbed regions \u2014the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions\u2014 and would protect them as part of its sovereign territory. Both houses of the Russian parliament will meet next week to approve the treaties for the regions to join Russia. ___ Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer and Zeke Miller contributed reporting.",

    "Russians push baseless theory blaming US for burst pipeline": [
        "By DAVID KLEPPERSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " The Kremlin and Russian state media are aggressively pushing a baseless conspiracy theory blaming the United States for damage to natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea in what analysts said Friday isanother effort to split the U.S. and its European allies. The Russian position is also reverberating onsocial mediaforums popular with American conservatives and far-right groups. NATO leaders believe the damage to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines between Russia and Germany is theresult of sabotage. NATO has refrained from identifying a suspect pending an investigation into the damage. Russia began blaming the U.S. quickly after the damage was reported Monday night. On Friday,speaking at a ceremony to annex four Ukrainian regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin said \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d in the West were behind the \u201cterror attacks\u201d but did not specify any nations. Pravda and otherRussian state outletsreported Thursday that the U.S. operates underwater robots capable of carrying out the acts of sabotage. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman wrote about her suspicions of U.S. involvement in a Telegram post. \u201cEurope must know the truth!\u201dMaria Zakharovawrote on Telegram Wednesday. President Joe Biden on Friday dismissed Russia\u2019s claims. \u201cIt was a deliberate act of sabotage. And now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies,\u201d Biden said. \u201c... When things calm down, we\u2019re going to send the divers down to find out exactly what happened. We don\u2019t know that yet exactly. But just don\u2019t listen to what Putin\u2019s saying. What he\u2019s saying we know is not true.\u201d The assertions of U.S. responsibility citeBiden\u2019s threatin February to stop the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine. \u201cIf Russia invades ... then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe will bring an end to it.\u201d The two Nord Stream lines were not in operation but were filled with tons of methane that began bubbling to the surface following the damage. Russia recently shut off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as it ramped up energy pressure on Europe.Nord Stream 2has never been used. Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson played the Biden clip on his show Tuesday and brought up the possibility that the U.S. was behind the sabotage. \u201cIf they did this, this will be one of the craziest, most destructive things any American administration has ever done, but it would also be totally consistent with what they do,\u201d Carlson said. Former PresidentDonald Trumpalso reposted Biden\u2019s remarks on Truth Social along with a call for the U.S. to remain \u201ccool, calm\u201d in its relations with Russia. \u201cWow. What a statement. World War III anyone?\u201d he wrote. Contacted for a response, a spokeswoman for Fox News forwarded transcripts from past episodes of Carlson\u2019s show, including one in which he discusseda conspiracy theory about supposed secret bioweapon research in Ukraine. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a message on Friday. The suggestion that the U.S. caused the damage was circulating on online forums popular with American conservatives and followers ofQAnon, aconspiracy theory movementwhich asserts that Trump is fighting a battle against a Satanic child-trafficking sect that controls world events. The claim\u2019s popularity among the American far-right and the speed with which it spread from Russian state media reflectmounting skepticismabout America\u2019s role in the war in Ukraine, according to Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Stimson Center and an expert on security and energy. \u201cRussia is quite good at capitalizing on these divides, but it doesn\u2019t create them,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not the first time Russia has spreaddisinformationseeking toredirect blamefor the war andundermine Ukraine\u2019s allies.

Networks allied with the Kremlin have also spread frightening tales aboutUkrainian refugees, and blamedatrocitiescommitted during the war on Ukrainians. Seen in that context, the conspiracy theory alleging U.S. responsibility for the pipeline damage is consistent, the researchers concluded. \u201cThe central theme is that this is a \u201cfalse-flag\u201d operation, an American plot designed to convince Europe that it was a Russian attack intended to signal the vulnerability of Europe\u2019s energy supplies,\u201d the researchers wrote. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of misinformation at https://apnews.com/hub/misinformation.",

    "Abortion ruling intensifies fight over state supreme courts": [
        "By ANDREW DeMILLOSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " Surrounded by states with abortion bans that took effect after Roe v. Wade fell, Illinois is one of the few places where the procedure remains legal in the Midwest. Abortion-rights supporters are worried that might not last. Their concern is shared in at least a half-dozen states, and this year it\u2019s not just about state legislatures. In Illinois, Democrats hold a supermajority, and the governor, a Democrat, is expected to win reelection. Instead, Republicans could be on the verge of winning control of the Illinois Supreme Court, where Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority. Two seats are up for election in November, prompting groups that have normally set their sights on other offices to concentrate attention and money on the judicial campaigns. \u201cThose are the only things we\u2019re focused on, because whoever wins control of the court will decide whether abortion remains legal in Illinois,\u201d said Terry Cosgrove, president and CEO of Personal PAC, an abortion rights group that has endorsed the two Democrats running for the high court. The same scene is playing out inother stateswith contentious high court races on the ballot this year. After the U.S. Supreme Courtstruck down Roe, state judicial races have become even more important for Democratic groups working to protect abortion rights. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the way access is playing out is at the state level, which puts the role of the court in stark relief,\u201d said Sarah Standiford, national campaigns director for Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The groups\u2019 involvement in states such as Illinois,Michiganand Ohio is a preview of how high-stakes normally sleepy court races are becoming. In Illinois, Appellate Court Justice Mary Kay O\u2019Brien is raising concerns about abortion rights as she runs against Republican Justice Michael Burke in a redrawn district for a seat currently held by a retiring Democratic justice. \u201cNow with Roe v. Wade being overturned, women\u2019s freedom to choose in Illinois is at risk,\u201d a recently launched ad for O\u2019Brien says. Meanwhile, the race for a court seat currently held by a Republican and covering counties northwest of Chicago pits Republican former Sheriff Mark Curran against Democrat Liz Rochford, a judge. Curran touted his opposition to abortion rights when he ran unsuccessfully for Senate two years ago. About $97 million was spent on state supreme court elections during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. Spending records could be shattered this year in states targeted by the right and left. One group is Alliance for Justice Action Campaign, which supports abortion access. It plans to reach voters in Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. \u201cWe were already planning to be involved in these states, but Dobbs has heightened our interest and heightened our sense of purpose and sense of mission on it,\u201d said Jake Faleschini, the group\u2019s legal director for state courts, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court decision. The races\u2019 importance was underscored recently when the Michigan Supreme Court, where Democratic appointees hold a slim majority, overruled a decision by a state certification board andallowed a constitutional amendmentensuring abortion rights on the November ballot. While Michigan\u2019s races are officially nonpartisan, the state\u2019s political parties nominate candidates. Democratic-backed Justice Richard Bernstein, who voted with the court\u2019s majority to put the abortion rights amendment on the ballot, is up for reelection along with Republican Justice Brian Zahra, who voted against it. The Republican Party also nominated Paul Hudson, while Democrats nominated Kyra Bolden. The two top finishers in the five-candidate race get seats. \u201cFolks here in Michigan are angry about the Roe decision. And I think that when they\u2019re looking for places to exercise their freedom to vote, they\u2019re going to look to the Supreme Court,\u201d state Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes said. Still, the candidates insist they aren\u2019t politicians and the role of the court is to be nonpartisan. Zahra, who has served since 2011, described a justice\u2019s role as saying \u201cwhat the law is and not what they think it ought to be.\u201d Abortion rights groups also are closely watching Kansas, where six of the seven Supreme Court justices face a statewide yes-or-no vote to stay on the bench for another six years. Two of the six were in the 6-1 majority that in 2019 declared access to abortion a \u201cfundamental\u201d right under the state Constitution, while another three were appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. The sixth justice on the ballot is considered the state\u2019s most conservative member. Democrats, moderate Republicans and others fear a quiet effort to remove justices after Kansas voters in August decisively rejected a proposed amendment that would have declared the state Constitution does not recognize a right to abortion. If it had passed, the Republican-controlled Legislature could have greatly restricted or banned the procedure. The state supreme court races that abortion rights supporters say they are most concerned with are ones Republicans already have been targeting, but for other issues. The Republican State Leadership Committee said it plans to spend more than $5 million \u2014 a record amount for the group \u2014 on supreme court races in Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Spokesman Andrew Romeo said the group\u2019s focus is on redistricting. In North Carolina, where abortion remains legal and Democrats hold a 4-3 majority on the high court, Republicans are trying to flip two seats. Trey Allen, the Republican hoping to unseat Democratic Justice Sam Ervin IV \u2014 whose grandfather presided over the Watergate hearings in the U.S. Senate \u2014 has accused the court of becoming too partisan. \u201cWe need justices who are going to follow the law in every case and leave their politics aside,\u201d he said during a recent forum. Democratic Appeals Court Judge Lucy Inman is vowing to keep the court \u201cfree of any political agenda\u201d as she runs against Republican Appeals Court Judge Richard Dietz for a seat currently held by a retiring Democrat. Abortion also is likely to play a major role in a technically nonpartisan Kentucky Supreme Court race this fall between longtime Republican state Rep. Joe Fischer and the incumbent, Michelle Keller. Republicans are pushing hard for Fischer, who sponsored the state\u2019s \u201ctrigger law\u201d ending abortion that took effect after Dobbs and also is behind a proposed anti-abortion constitutional amendment on the ballot. In Ohio, Republicans are trying to keep their 4-3 majority on the court, with two GOP justices defending their seats. A third race pits two sitting justices \u2014 a Republican and a Democrat \u2014 against each other for chief justice. Ohio\u2019s court is likely to be another battleground over abortion after a county judge temporarily blocked a ban that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Rhiannon Carnes, co-founder and co-executive director of Ohio Women\u2019s Alliance Action Fund, said her group has been calling and texting voters, and will be sending direct mail about the court races. \u201cThere has just been so much talk about the federal Supreme Court,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do more in the states about the influence and power of our state supreme court.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Hannah Schoenbaum in Raleigh, North Carolina; Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky, and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics Follow AP\u2019s coverage about abortion at https://apnews.com/hub/abortion",

    "Dysfunction in Texas AG\u2019s office as Paxton seeks third term": [
        "By JAKE BLEIBERGSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " GATESVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s staff this month quietly dropped a series of human trafficking and child sexual assault cases after losing track of one of the victims, a stumble in open court emblematic of broader dysfunction inside one of America\u2019s most prominent law offices. The Republican has elevated his national profile in recent years, energizing the right by rushing into contentious court battles that have affected people far beyond Texas. He has fought access to abortion, Democratic immigration policy and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But as Paxton seeks to fend off legal troubles and win a third term as Texas\u2019 top law enforcement official, his agency has come unmoored by disarray behind the scenes, with seasoned lawyers quitting over practices they say aim to slant legal work, reward loyalists and drum out dissent. An Associated Press investigation found Paxton and his deputies have sought to turn cases to political advantage or push a broader political agenda, including staff screenings of a debunked film questioning the 2020 election. Adding to the unrest was the secretive firing of a Paxton supporter less than two months into his job as an agency advisor after he tried to make a point by displaying child pornography in a meeting. The AP\u2019s account is based on hundreds of pages of records and interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation or because they were not authorized to talk publicly. In the small town of Gatesville, the fallout was felt this month with the collapse of cases dubbed \u201cOperation Fallen Angel.\u201d Six of the people indicted last year on allegations that they were involved in a scheme to force teenage girls to \u201cexchange sexual contact for crystal methamphetamine\u201d are now free. One is being held in the central Texas community on other charges. An eighth died in jail. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely broken. It\u2019s just broken. You don\u2019t do it this way,\u201d Republican District Attorney Dusty Boyd said of the attorney general\u2019s office, which took over the cases from his five-lawyer team. \u201cI made the mistake of trusting them that they would come in and do a good job.\u201d Paxton and his staff did not respond to voicemails, text messages and email questions sent Tuesday. For years, Paxton has weathered a storm of troubles like few other elected officials in the U.S., includingfelony securities fraudcharges and afederal investigationinto accusations of corruption.He has broadly denied wrongdoing and remained popular with GOP voters, even while losing staff. One prosecutor said he quit in January after supervisors pressured him to withhold evidence in a murder case. Another attorney signed a resignation letter in March that warned of growing hostility toward LGBTQ employees. By August, records show the division over human trafficking cases \u2014 a major emphasis in Texas, where more than50 migrants diedin the back of a trailer in June \u2014 had a job vacancy rate of 40%. \u201cWhen you\u2019re experiencing the type of climactic upheaval in an office, which affects agency-client relationships and trust, there\u2019s naturally going to be a lot of movement among staff,\u201d said Ron Del Vento, who served as a division chief under Paxton and four previous Texas attorneys general before retiring in 2019. \u201cCollateral damage is inevitable,\u201d he said. The latest departures are aftershocks of an extraordinary revolt in autumn 2020, when eight of Paxton\u2019s top deputies accused the attorney general of using the office to help apolitical donorwho employed a woman with whom Paxton acknowledged having had anextramarital affair.The deputies all quit or were fired after going to the FBI, which opened an investigation thatremains ongoing. In America\u2019s largest red state, the accusations have not given GOP voters pause about Paxton, who carried Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement into againwinning his party\u2019s nomination.Paxton faces Democratic challenger Rochelle Garza, a first-time candidate and former ACLU attorney, in the November election. \u201cHe\u2019s been one of the greatest attorneys general for the state of Texas and one of the most conservative ones in the entire country,\u201d said Abraham George, chairman of the Collin County Republican Party, adding that Paxton deserves the same presumption of innocence as any other American. After the dramatic exit of Paxton\u2019s top staff in 2020, those brought into senior roles included a California attorney who donated $10,000 to help Paxton fight his2015 securities fraud indictmentand Tom Kelly Gleason, a former ice cream company owner whosefather gave $50,000to the attorney general\u2019s legal defense fund. Gleason was fired less than two months into his new job as a law enforcement adviser. Paxton\u2019s office has not disclosed why, but three people with knowledge of the matter said Gleason included child pornography in a work presentation at the agency\u2019s Austin headquarters. The people said Gleason displayed the video \u2014 which one of them described as showing a man raping a small child \u2014 in a misguided effort to underscore agency investigators difficult work. It was met with outrage and caused the meeting to quickly dissolve. Afterward, Paxton\u2019s top deputy, Brent Webster, told staff not to talk about what happened, according to one of the people. Gleason, who began his career as a police officer in the late 1970s, did not respond to voicemails, text messages, emails and letters left at this home and business. A lawyer who has represented him also did not respond to an email seeking comment. As of August, payroll data show the number of assistant attorneys general \u2014 the line lawyers who handle daily case and litigation work \u2014 in the criminal prosecutions division was down more than 25% from two years ago. The data, which was obtained under public records law, show the group that handles financial and white-collar cases was cut by more than half and merged with another division. \u201cThis is scary to me for the people of Texas,\u201d said Linda Eads, who served as a deputy attorney general in the early 2000s, when she said it was rare for any division to have more than two or three vacancies. Boyd said staff turnover in Paxton\u2019s human trafficking unit contributed to the collapse of the cases in Gatesville. In the last two years, Republican lawmakers have doubled the division\u2019s budget to $3 million, but Boyd questioned whether it was well spent. On Sept. 13, the attorney general\u2019s staff wrote in court papers that they were dismissing three trafficking cases because a witness had recanted and dropping the other four because they were \u201cunable to locate victim.\u201d \u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, you\u2019re the AG\u2019s office. You can\u2019t find the victim?\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThe culture is broken.\u201d Bill Turner, who spent five years in the office under Paxton, said he quit in January after senior leaders tried to prevent him from turning over evidence to the defense in a murder prosecution. He would not discuss specifics, saying that could affect ongoing work related to the case. \u201cWe had a difference of opinion on the ethical obligations of a prosecutor and I didn\u2019t feel like I could continue working in that environment,\u201d said Turner, who was previously an elected Democratic district attorney in Texas. Two months later, assistant attorney general Jason Scully-Clemmons left the same division, accusing a new wave of executives in his resignation letter of \u201cdirecting prosecutors to prioritize political considerations.\u201d He also said the environment had grown hostile to LGBTQ employees around the time Paxton issued a legal opinion that set in motionchild abuse investigationsinto the parents of transgender youth in Texas. Several other employees told AP that before Texas\u2019 March primary elections, Amber Platt, a deputy over criminal justice cases, convened a meeting to ask about upcoming cases that would help Paxton\u2019s reelection prospects. Scully-Clemmons, who declined to comment, referred to the meeting in his letter. In May, the head of Paxton\u2019s election integrity division invited his team to a movie theater for a screening of\u201c2000 Mules,\u201dthe debunked film that falsely claims to prove the 2020 election was stolen. \u201cGeneral Paxton will be present, among others, and I think they would love to have a good showing from our office,\u201d assistant attorney general Jonathan White wrote in an email. As senior lawyers have been leaving the attorney general\u2019s office, newcomers who\u2019ve stuck by Paxton have seen their careers and compensation skyrocket. Aaron Reitz, who finished law school in 2017, was hired as an aide to Paxton\u2019s top deputy at a salary of $135,000 in October 2020. The next month, after the deputy reported Paxton to the FBI and quit, Reitz was promoted to oversee agency legal strategy, a senior job making $205,000. In June, Reitz\u2019s assistant sent out invitations to a \u201c2000 Mules viewing party,\u201d complete with barbecue. More than 90 staff and interns were later told to bring their own lunch. ____ Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York and writers Paul J.

    "TikTok politics: Candidates turn to it \u2018for better or worse\u2019": [
        "By DAVID KLEPPERSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " Wade Herring didn\u2019t know the teenage voter who approached him at a restaurant over the weekend. But she knew Herring, a Democrat running for Congress in Georgia, from his campaign videos on TikTok. To Herring, a 63-year-old Savannah attorney, it was proof of TikTok\u2019s precision-guided ability to reach young voters \u2014 the very reason why he and candidates from both parties have eagerly embraced the platform ahead of the2022 midterm elections. \u201cA year and a half ago, I thought it was just dancing videos,\u201d Herring said of TikTok. Young voters, he added, \u201caren\u2019t watching CNN, or MSNBC or Fox. They\u2019re getting their information on TikTok, and for better or worse, it\u2019s the way to reach them.\u201d For a number of government officials, it\u2019s worse. TikTok\u2019s popularity has surged despite worries from policy makers in Washington about TikTok\u2019s handling of user data and misinformation, as well as its ties to China\u2019s government. Those fears prompted the U.S. armed forces to prohibit the app on military devices, and spurred calls to ban it on all government computers and phones as well. \u201cI have serious concerns about the opportunities that the Chinese communist party has to access TikTok\u2019s data on American users,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said at a hearing this month focused on the national security implications of social media. Still, its reach is undeniable. TikTok is consumed by two-thirds of American teens, a number that has risen as other platforms have lost popularity. It\u2019s the world\u2019s most downloaded app, and the second-most visited website after Google. And it\u2019s not just about viral dance challenges anymore, but also a place toshop,learn about beauty,fashionor sports, and even find out how to register to vote. The benefits of using the platform are simply too great to pass up even with concerns about TikTok as a conduit for misinformation or exploiting privacy. \u201cPeople are going to use it. It\u2019s a highly effective tool,\u201d said Colton Hess, who created Tok the Vote, a 2020 voter registration and engagement effort that reached tens of millions of young voters. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s the game in play, you have to be in the arena.\u201d TikTok is owned by ByteDance Ltd., a Chinese company that moved to new headquarters in Singapore in 2020. Questions about the company\u2019s ties to the Chinese government have hounded TikTok even as its popularity exploded. At the Senate hearing earlier this month, members of both parties questioned a TikTok executive about the influence ofgovernment officials in China, and whether that country\u2019s authoritarian leaders have control over the platform\u2019sdataand content. TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas, based in Los Angeles, said the company protects all data from American users and that Chinese government officials have no access to it. \u201cWe will never share data, period,\u201d Pappas said. TikTok also says it works to stop the flow of harmful misinformation and has created anelection centerto help users find information about U.S. elections, voting and candidates. The platform\u2019s defenders also note that TikTok isn\u2019t the only sitecriticized for failing to stop misinformation. Its rivals \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube \u2014 face their own challenges regarding data privacy too. Areportreleased this month from New York University faulted all four of those platforms plus TikTok for amplifying former President Donald Trump\u2019sliesabout the2020 election. The study cited inconsistent rules regarding misinformation as well as poor enforcement. \u201cWhile TikTok has these very strong sounding policies, the enforcement is extremely erratic,\u201d said Paul Barrett, the professor and researcher who led the study. Anotherstudy this month by NewsGuard, a firm that monitors online misinformation, found that nearly 1 in 5 TikTok videos about key news events contained misinformation. The videos focused on topics likeCOVID-19, the 2020 election,Russia\u2019s war in Ukraineand theJan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. TikTok\u2019s ties to Chinaset it apart from other platforms, according to Geoffrey Cain, a senior fellow at the Lincoln Network, a conservative-leaning think tank that studies technology policy. The country\u2019s leaders have shown a willingness to spread disinformation that undermines the West, he said, and it would be foolish to think they haven\u2019t tried to enlist TikTok in this work. \u201cThis is not the Cold War where we had hardware, where we had missiles pointed at each other,\u201d Cain said. \u201cNow we have smart phones.\u201d TikTok is not available in China. Instead, the platform\u2019s parent company offers a similar platform that has the same dance videos, but also promotes educational content about math and science, experts told lawmakers at the recent Senate hearing. Another difference: the Chinese version limits 13- and 14-year-old users to 40 minutes a day. No such limits are included in the U.S. version, which prohibits users under 13. Concerned about China\u2019s influence over TikTok, the Trump administration in 2020threatened to ban the appwithin the U.S. and pressured ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. company. U.S. officials and the company are now in talks over a possible agreement that would resolve American security concerns. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., helped write the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act when he served in the House, and supports new regulations for data collection and marketing to children that he sayswill make platforms like TikTok safer. He\u2019s not waiting for those changes to happen before using the platform, however. Markey emerged as an unlikely TikTok sensation in 2020 when his videos were credited with helping himdefeat a primary challenge from former Rep. Joe Kennedy. \u201cI feel lucky to join them online in pursuit of a better future and a livable planet,\u201d Markey said of young voters, who he said areespecially concerned about climate changeand other environmental challenges. While the right video can reach hundreds of thousands or even millions of viewers, TikTok also works in reverse, giving politicians and advocacy groups a window into the concerns of millions of young Americans whose political influence will only grow, according to Ellen Sciales, director of communications for the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led organization that works to address climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s young people talking to other young people. It\u2019s meeting them where they\u2019re at,\u201d said Sciales, 25. Younger voters will judge candidates based on their stances on issues instead of whether they\u2019re on TikTok or not, Sciales said, adding that those who stay off the platform are missing out on a powerful tool for organizing and communicating with voters. It\u2019s a gamble some lawmakers say they\u2019re not willing to take. \u201cI would have a great deal of caution about TikTok at this point,\u201d Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said in July. \u201cI would not have TikTok on any of my devices.\u201d",

    "Stacey Abrams looks to win Black men in bid for Ga. governor": [
        "By JEFF AMY and BILL BARROWSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 DemocratStacey Abramswas on stage for an hour with radio and television host Charlamagne tha God and rapper 21 Savage when she faced a question from a skeptical audience member. \u201cA lot of politicians speak about their plan and what they plan to do, but I also notice that I never hear a clear turnaround of when their plan will go into effect,\u201d said Soheem Perry, who lives in suburban Atlanta. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen within the time that\u2019s been promised, how should we feel about our vote?\u201d Perry captured the alienation some Black Americans feel about the political process. Democrats court their votes every election year yet sometimes struggle to deliver on certain promises. But in her bid to become America\u2019s first Black woman governor, Abrams needs support even from disillusioned voters. The concern is especially acute when it comes to Black men, who some analysts suggest have trickled recently to Republicans. A large majority of Black men have still cast votes for Democrats in recent elections, meaning the bigger fear in a tight race is that they won\u2019t vote at all. Abrams acknowledges the possibility. She built her national profile by insisting Democrats can compete in Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold, if they attract marginal or disaffected voters, including Black men. \u201cIf Black men turn out in the numbers and support me at the levels they\u2019re capable of, I can win this election, because we know Black men sometimes punch below their weight class,\u201d Abrams said at the event. \u201cThey\u2019ve got reasons to be distrustful, and they\u2019ve got reasons to be disconnected. And it is not only disingenuous, it would be bad practice, for me to not do the work to show that I understand.\u201d To maximize Black male support, Abrams has held a series of events targeting them. A recent gathering in an un-air-conditioned warehouse featured free food and T-shirts. Abrams delivered bits of her standard speech in response to questions from Charlemagne, 21 Savage and civil rights lawyer Francys Johnson. But the topics were tilted toward the audience, with discussions of how Abrams opposes letting prosecutors use rap lyrics in gang prosecutions, how she wants to decriminalize \u2014 but not legalize \u2014 marijuana because she fears federal criminal charges, and how she believes Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has abandoned efforts to make Georgia\u2019s criminal justice system less punitive. \u201cWe need leadership that sees us, that serves us and that believes in us,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThe current governor has proven on every one of those metrics that he does not care.\u201d Black voters made up 29% of the general electorate during Abrams\u2019 2018 gubernatorial bid, according to Georgia voting records. Abrams won 94% of Black votes, according to AP VoteCast data, and still lost to Kemp by about 55,000 votes out of 4 million cast. In 2020, President Joe Biden topped Donald Trump in Georgia by less than 12,000 votes out of 5 million. Strong turnout among white voters meant Black voters accounted for 27% of that electorate, with VoteCast showing that Biden won 92% of the Black vote. In Georgia\u2019s 2021 runoffs, which elected two Democrats to the U.S. Senate, Black voters cast 28% of ballots. Yet in these and other elections, a significantly larger share of Black women voted than Black men. Abrams\u2019 team identifies 3.9 million Georgia voters as its universe of potential support, but knows she won\u2019t get them all, said campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo. About 2.5 million are Black, Groh-Wargo said. Biden, at almost 2.5 million votes in 2020, won more votes than any Democrat ever before in Georgia. Abrams got 1.92 million votes in 2018. A subtext in Abrams\u2019 effort is that Black men may be overshadowed in the Democratic Party by Black women. Black women have long been an anchor of Democrats\u2019 coalition. They were credited with putting Alabama Democrat Doug Jones over the top in an upset U.S. Senate victory in 2017. Abrams\u2019 2018 near-miss forced a rethinking by white-dominated donor circles and media about Black women\u2019s viability as statewide candidates. Biden\u2019s path to the White House further affirmed Black women\u2019s political power. In the Democratic primaries, Biden lost badly in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire before surging to the nomination largely by sweeping Southern states with larger Black populations, driven by strong turnout in particular from Black women. With that in mind, Biden, as president, has elevated women of color. Kamala Harris, his vice president, is Black and of Jamaican and Indian descent, and the first woman to hold the office. Biden also delivered on a campaign promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, resulting inKetanji Brown Jackson becoming the court\u2019s 116th justice. Ns\u00e9 Ufot, who leads the New Georgia Project, a voting rights group Abrams founded as a state lawmaker, said it would be \u201cdisingenuous\u201d to say the newfound attention on Black women is \u201cnot a factor\u201d in how some Black men view politics currently. But Ufot said any resentments \u201care not as big a deal as the hand-wringing class\u201d might think. \u201cThe question is whether she can make the hard sell, taking the case directly to Black men.\u201d Abrams herself disputes any characterization that her focus on Black men reveals a \u201cweakness\u201d in her campaign. \u201cEvery candidate, every campaign has to work hard to make certain that people believe it\u2019s worth voting, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she told a gathering of Black journalists this week in Washington, adding that she\u2019s trying to address \u201cdistrust and despair\u201d among voters who \u201care not seeing the results they thought they would see.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s not that Black men aren\u2019t overwhelmingly faithful Democrats, said Leah Wright Rigueur, a Johns Hopkins University expert on African American political power. \u201cThe majority of Black men are exactly where they were a couple of years ago, which is that they\u2019re consistent and loyal and partisan voters and supporters of Democratic candidates,\u201d she said. But Wright Rigueur said former President Barack Obama maxed out support from Black men, drawing some Black Republicans who\u2019ve since moved back toward the GOP. She also said others are frustrated that previous Democratic victories haven\u2019t had a big impact on their lives. \u201cThere is a cross section of Black men that manifest their frustration with failures of the Democratic Party by saying, \u2018You have to earn my vote,\u2019\u201d she said. One of those is Tim Black, a Washington commentator who says he\u2019s an independent. He warned in a recent video that it would a be a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to blame Black men if Abrams loses, and that no one has an \u201cobligation\u201d to back her. \u201cWe\u2019re tired as hell of being talked down to,\u201d Black said. \u201cHere\u2019s a radical idea: Instead of telling us who to vote for, give us some tangible reasons to vote for you.\u201d Abrams seemed to sense that criticism at her event, holding up her policy ideas as ways to help people directly. \u201cThere\u2019s a Twitter universe that presumes that if you don\u2019t say exactly what they want to hear, you don\u2019t have an agenda for Black men. I get it,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIt just so happens that I know that if the agenda for Black men works, it works for everyone.\u201d Groh-Wargo described voters overall as \u201cexhausted\u201d by the 2020 campaign, including the Senate runoffs two months after the presidential election. She acknowledged frustrations among less habitual Democratic voters who \u201cshowed up\u201d to defeat Trump only to face a pandemic economy, inflation and nonstop campaigning. \u201cThere\u2019s a Black men\u2019s Democratic problem in California. It\u2019s not just us,\u201d Groh-Wargo said. \u201cThere is softness because Black voters in America are having this collective experience. ... People do not feel seen and heard.\u201d But, she insisted, \u201cThey don\u2019t feel that way about Stacey,\u201d because Abrams is \u201cshowing up.\u201d For Perry, the voter who asked whether Abrams could keep her promises, that may be enough. He said Abrams didn\u2019t fully answer his question, but his \u201cgut feeling about her ... is genuineness.\u201d And, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s what I normally feel like I don\u2019t feel from politicians.\u201d",

    "House approves antitrust bill targeting Big Tech dominance": [
        "By MARCY GORDONSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House on Thursday approved antitrust legislation targeting the dominance of Big Tech companies by giving states greater power in competition cases and increasing money for federal regulators. The bipartisan measure passed by a 242-184 vote. It was separated from more ambitious provisions aimed at reining in Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple and cleared by key House and Senate committees. Those proposals have languished for months, giving the companies time for vigorous lobbying campaigns against them. The more limited bill would give states an upper hand over companies in choosing the location of courts that decide federal antitrust cases. Proponents say this change would avert the \u201chome-court advantage\u201d that Big Tech companies enjoy in federal court in Northern California, where many of the cases are tried and many of the companies are based. Many state attorneys general have pursued antitrust cases against the industry, and many states joined with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission in their landmark lawsuits against Google and Meta (then called Facebook), respectively, in late 2020. The bill also would increase filing fees paid by companies to federal agencies for all proposed mergers worth $500 million or more, while reducing the fees for small and medium-sized transactions. The aim is to increase revenue for federal enforcement efforts. Under the bill, companies seeking approval for mergers would have to disclose subsidies they received from countries deemed to pose strategic or economic risks to the United States \u2014 especially China. \u201cWe find ourselves in a monopoly moment as a country,\u201d Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., said before the vote. \u201cMultibillion-dollar corporations have grown into behemoths, eliminating any real competition in their industries and using their dominance to hurt small businesses and consumers. Meta\u2019s monopoly power has enabled it to harm women, children and people of all ages without recourse. Amazon has used its dominance to copy competitors\u2019 products and run small businesses into the ground.\u201d The Biden administration, which has pushed for antitrust legislation targeting Big Tech, endorsed the bill this week. The legislation drew fierce opposition from conservative Republicans who split from their GOP colleagues supporting the bill. The conservatives objected to the proposed revenue increase for the antitrust regulators, arguing there has been brazen overreach by the FTC under President Joe Biden. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., described the FTC\u2019s leader, Lina Khan, as a \u201ca radical leftist seeking to replace consumers\u2019 decisions with her own.\u201d Another California Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa, told his colleagues, \u201cIf you want to stifle innovation, vote for this.\u201d If Republicans win control of the House or Senate in the November elections, they are certain to try to crimp the activism of the FTC and to challenge its broader interpretation of its legal authority. The more sweeping antitrust proposals would restrict powerful tech companies from favoring their own products and services over rivals on their platforms and could even lead to mandated breakups separating companies\u2019 dominant platforms from their other businesses. They could, for example, prevent Amazon from steering consumers to its own brands and away from competitors\u2019 products on its giant e-commerce platform. The drafting of that legislation marked a new turn in Congress\u2019 effort to curb the dominance of the tech giants and anti-competitive practices that critics say have hurt consumers, small businesses and innovation. But the proposal is complex and drew objections to some provisions from lawmakers of both parties, even though all condemn the tech giants\u2019 conduct. Lawmakers have faced a delicate task as they try to tighten reins around a powerful industry whose services, mostly free or nearly so, are popular with consumers and embedded into daily life. So with time to act running out as the November elections approach in about six weeks, lawmakers extracted the less controversial provisions on antitrust court venues and merger filing fees, putting them into the new bill that passed. Lawmakers added the provision targeting foreign subsidies to U.S. companies. Republicans especially have vocally criticized the Chinese ownership of popular video platform TikTok. In the Senate, Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar is sponsoring similar legislation with Republicans Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Mike Lee of Utah. \u201cEffective antitrust enforcement is critical to ensuring consumers and small businesses have the opportunity to compete,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement Thursday. \u201cEnforcers cannot take on the biggest companies the world has ever known with duct tape and Band-Aids.\u201d",

    "Biden vows US commitment to Pacific Islands at summit": [
        "By AAMER MADHANI, MATTHEW LEE and DARLENE SUPERVILLESeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday told visiting leaders from more than a dozen Pacific Island countries that the U.S. was committed to bolstering its presence in their region and becoming a more collaborative partner as they face the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of climate change. The president addressed the leaders who gathered in Washington for a summit as the White House looks to improve relations in the Pacific amid growing U.S. concern about China\u2019s growing military and economic influence. \u201cA great deal of history of our world is going to be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years and decades,\u201d Biden said at the start of a meeting with island leaders at the State Department. \u201cAnd the Pacific Islands are a critical voice in shaping the future, and that\u2019s why my administration has made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with your countries.\u201d Biden delivered his remarks as his administration unveiled its Pacific strategy, an outline of the White House\u2019s plan to assist the region\u2019s leaders on pressing issues like climate change, maritime security and protecting the area from overfishing. The administration also pledged that the U.S. would add $810 million in new aid for Pacific Island nations over the next decade, including $130 million on efforts to stymie the impacts of climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the consequences of climate change around the world very vividly, including in the United States right now, and I know your nations feel it acutely,\u201d Biden said. Leaders from Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and New Caledonia are attending the two-day summit that Secretary of State Antony Blinken kicked off Wednesday. Vanuatu and Nauru sent representatives, and Australia, New Zealand and the secretary-general of the Pacific Island Forum sent observers, according to the White House. The president hosted leaders for a dinner Thursday evening at the White House. The summit comes amid worrying signs to the U.S. that Beijing has grown its influence in the region.Earlier this year, the Solomon Islands signed a new security pact with Beijing, and ahead of the summit signaled it would be hesitant to sign any end-of-summit statement critical of China. The Marshall Islands this month suspended talks to renew its security partnership with the U.S., citing the longstanding impact of U.S. nuclear testing in the area some 70 years ago. A joint declaration issued at the end of the summit included a nod to those concerns. It stated that the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to addressing the Republic of the Marshall Islands\u2019 ongoing environmental, public health concerns, and other welfare concerns\u201d and \u201cto the safe removal and disposal of unexploded ordnance.\u201d Among the new initiatives the White House announced are plans to ask Congress to appropriate $600 million over 10 years to support economic development, promote climate resilience efforts for Pacific fisheries and more. The administration says it will also establish a regional mission of the U.S. Agency for International Development in Suva, Fiji. The White House also reiterated previously announced plans to open embassies in the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Kiribati. The White House also announced plans to recognize the Cook Islands and Niue as sovereign states, after \u201cappropriate consultations.\u201d The U.S. currently recognizes the islands as self-governing territories. Meg Keen, the director of the Pacific Islands program for the Australia-based Lowy Institute, said the recognition means the Cook Islands and Niue would be eligible for some of the U.S. funding announced by Biden on Thursday. The 16-page document notes \u201cheightened geopolitical competition impacts\u201d for the Pacific Island countries that also directly affect the United States. \u201cIncreasingly those impacts include pressure and economic coercion by the People\u2019s Republic of China, which risks undermining the peace, prosperity, and security of the region, and by extension, of the United States,\u201d the strategy document says. \u201cThese challenges demand renewed U.S. engagement across the full Pacific Islands region.\u201d Among the broad strategy aims laid out by the Biden administration in the document are expanding the number of U.S. diplomatic missions from six to nine across the Pacific and completing work to renew strategic partnership agreements with the Pacific Island nations of Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands that are set to soon expire. The strategy also calls for increasing the presence in the region of the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Pentagon. White House officials acknowledge that U.S. inattentiveness toward the region since the end of the Cold War has left an opening for Beijing to exert its influence. Plans for the summit were announced earlier this month, just days after the Solomon Islands called on the U.S. and Britain not to send naval vessels to the South Pacific nation until approval processes are overhauled. The Solomons in April signed a new security pact with China. Ahead of the summit, the Solomon Islands signaled it was unlikely to sign on to an end-of-summit joint statement, according to a diplomat familiar with summit planning. The diplomat, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the resistance was driven in part by the Solomon Islands\u2019 tightening relationship with Beijing. But in the end, the Solomon Islands signed on to the joint declaration. The statement instead included calls for bolstering the Pacific economy, tackling climate change, maintaining peace and security across the Pacific, and more, but avoided any direct mention of China. Besides their meeting with Biden, island leaders met Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u2014 Associated Press writers Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "GOP states sue Biden administration over student loan plan": [
        "By SEUNG MIN KIMSeptember 30, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Six Republican-led states are suing the Biden administration in an effort to halt its plan to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans, accusing it of overstepping its executive powers. It\u2019sat least the second legal challenge this weekto the sweeping proposal laid out by President Joe Biden in late August, when he said his administrationwould cancel up to $20,000 in education debtfor huge numbers of borrowers. The announcement, after months of internal deliberations and pressure from liberal activists, became immediate political fodder ahead of the November midterms while fueling arguments from conservatives about legality. As the lawsuit was being filed, the Biden administration quietly scaled back eligibility rules for the debt relief, eliminating a relatively small group of borrowers who are the subject of legal debate in the suit. Those borrowers, whose loans are backed by the federal government but owned by private banks \u2014 a relic of defunct lending programs \u2014 are now ineligible for Biden\u2019s debt cancellation, the Education Department said. In the lawsuit, being filed Thursday in a federal court in Missouri, the Republican states argue that Biden\u2019s cancellation plan is \u201cnot remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers,\u201d as required by the 2003 federal law that the administration is using as legal justification. They point out that Biden, in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d this month, declared the COVID-19 pandemic over, yet is still using the ongoing health emergency to justifythe wide-scale debt relief. \u201cIt\u2019s patently unfair to saddle hard-working Americans with the loan debt of those who chose to go to college,\u201d Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, who is leading the group, said in an interview. She added: \u201cThe Department of Education is required, under the law, to collect the balance due on loans. And President Biden does not have the authority to override that.\u201d The states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina joined Arkansas in filing the lawsuit. Iowa has a Democratic attorney general, but the state\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, signed on the state\u2019s behalf. The states argue that Missouri\u2019s loan servicer is facing a \u201cnumber of ongoing financial harms\u201d because of Biden\u2019s decision to cancel loans. Other states that joined the lawsuit argue that Biden\u2019s forgiveness plan will ultimately disrupt revenue to state coffers. In particular, the suit alleges that Missouri\u2019s loan servicer will lose revenue from loans it owns through the Federal Family Education Loan Program \u2014 a program that allowed private banks to issue and manage federally backed student loans until the program was disbanded in 2010. The Education Department updated its website Thursday saying borrowers with federal loans that are owned by private banks, including the FFEL program and Perkins loans, will now be ineligible unless they already consolidated their loans into the government\u2019s direct lending program before Thursday. The change will reverse eligibility for about 770,000 borrowers, the department said. \u201cOur goal is to provide relief to as many eligible borrowers as quickly and easily as possible, and this will allow us to achieve that goal while we continue to explore additional legally-available options to provide relief to borrowers with privately owned FFEL loans and Perkins loans,\u201d the department said in a statement. Still, the administration has long said it was confident the forgiveness program would survive court challenges. \u201cRepublican officials from these six states are standing with special interests, and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt,\u201d White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan said Thursday. \u201cThe president and his administration are lawfully giving working and middle class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January. \u201d Biden\u2019s forgiveness programwill cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000 in income.Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, will get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven. The administration also said it would extend the current pause on federal student loan repayments \u2014 put on hold near the start of the pandemic more than two years ago \u2014 once more through the end of the year. The administration faced threats of legal challenges to its plans almost immediately, with conservative attorneys, Republican lawmakers and business-oriented groups asserting that Biden was overstepping his authority in taking such sweeping action without the assent of Congress. Democratic lawmakers battling in tough reelection contests also distanced themselves from the student loan plan, as Republican officials called it an unfair government giveaway for relatively affluent people at the expense of those who didn\u2019t pursue higher education. In their lawsuit, the Republican attorneys general also contend that the forgiveness program violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which lays out how federal agencies should make regulations in order to ensure executive branch policies are well-reasoned and explained. \u201cThe president does not have the authority to put himself in the place of Congress,\u201d Rutledge said in the interview. \u201cThese actions must be taken by Congress and he can\u2019t override that.\u201d To justify the plan\u2019s legality, the Biden administration isrelying on a post-Sept. 11, 2001, lawmeant to help members of the military that the Justice Department says allows Biden to reduce or erase student loan debt during a national emergency. But Republicans argue the administration is misinterpreting the law because, in part, the pandemic no longer qualifies as a national emergency. Another lawsuit against Biden\u2019s student loan program was filed this week in an Indiana federal court by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian legal advocacy group that employs a lawyer who says he would be harmed by the forgiveness plan. The lawyer, Frank Garrison, says erasing his current debt load will trigger a tax liability from the state of Indiana, which is among at least a half dozen states where theforgiven loan amounts will be subject to state taxes. A federal judge on Thursday rejected Garrison\u2019s request to temporarily block Biden\u2019s plan, saying there\u2019s no evidence he will be \u201cirreparably harmed\u201d by the cancellation. Garrison was given until Oct. 10 to revise his argument. The White House dismissed the lawsuit as baseless because any borrower who does not want the debt relief can opt out. The Education Department is still on track to unveil the application for the forgiveness plan in early October, and it sent an email to borrowers Thursday explaining how to prepare to apply. The email noted that applicants do not have to submit any supporting documents. Republicans have also seized on the Biden plan\u2019s price tag and its impact on the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the program willcost about $400 billion over the next three decades. The White House countered that the CBO\u2019s estimate of how much the plan will cost just in its first year, $21 billion, is lower than what the administration initially believed. ___ Associated Press writer Collin Binkley contributed to this report.",

    "New federal prisons chief vows to fix troubles, regain trust": [
        "By MICHAEL R. SISAK and MICHAEL BALSAMOSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The new director of the federal Bureau of Prisons vowed Thursday that \u201cthe buck stops with me\u201d when it comes to fixing the crisis-plagued agency, ticking off a list of top priorities, from solving a staffing crisis to ending widespread misconduct. Colette Peters\u2019 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 the first time she\u2019s appeared before Congress \u2014 was a stark departure fromthe combative nature of her predecessor, who drew bipartisan rebukes for foisting blame on others and refusing to accept responsibility for the agency\u2019s problems. Peters, who started in August, saidthe troubles she inheritedhave eroded trust in the agency among staff, inmates and the public. She cautioned that it\u2019ll take time to turn around the Justice Department\u2019s largest component, with 122 facilities, 159,000 inmates and a budget of more than $8 billion \u2014 but that it must be done. \u201cThese individuals in our care have the right to feel safe when they are incarcerated with us,\u201d Peters told The Associated Press after testifying. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure their safety.\u201d The Bureau of Prisons has been underincreasing scrutinyfrom Congress amid myriad crises, many of themexposed by AP reporting, includingrampant sexual abuse of inmatesby staff and otherstaff criminal conduct,chronic understaffinghamperingemergency responses,escapesand deaths. Peters,previously the director of Oregon\u2019s state prison system, was brought in to run the Bureau of Prisons as a reform-minded outsider. Unlike past directors who worked their way up the ranks, she\u2019d never been a federal prison employee before taking the top job. Peters said she wants people to come out of prison better than they went in, telling senators, \u201cOur job is to make good neighbors, not good inmates.\u201d Currently, though, the federal prison system isn\u2019t always putting former inmates in a position to succeed, advocates say. Because of staffing shortages, inmates aren\u2019t always able to take classes and access other programming that could help them on the outside. Some inmates eligible for early release underthe First Step Act\u2014 a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul measure signed during the Trump administration \u2014 have been left to languish while paperwork piles up for overworked, understaffed case managers, advocates say. In the weeks since Peters took charge of the Bureau of Prisons, she has made changes to the system\u2019s organizational chart that she said will improve communications between its headquarters and its 122 facilities. Other changes include hiring of 40 additional internal affairs staff, which she said will improve handling and address a backlog of misconduct investigations. Peters said the agency has been conducting what it terms cultural assessments of its facilities, starting with its women\u2019s prisons,like the one in Dublin, California, where aformer wardenand four workers were charged with sexually abusing employees. Based on those findings, the agency is making sure workers are trained in gender responsiveness and trauma-informed care, said Peters, who visited the Dublin prison this month. She also promised to visit another problem prison: the Atlanta federal penitentiary that has been overrun with misconduct and corruption and was the subject of a July hearing of the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. At the same time, Peters must figure out a way to solve the agency\u2019s severe staffing shortage and shore up crumbling infrastructure. With many vacant positions, prisons have been using cooks, teachers, nurses and other workers to guard inmates, raising questions about whether the agency is keeping prisoners and staff safe and keeping up with programming and classes, as required by law. Peters said the makeshift staffing practice, known as augmentation, should only be used in true staffing emergencies, not as a permanent fix for dwindling guard ranks. Peters, expressing concern for employee wellness, said the agency\u2019s increased reliance on overtime and augmentation during the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated \u201cwear and tear\u201d on prison workers. But augmentation might not be going away any time soon, with attrition only accelerating the agency\u2019s staffing decline and hiring efforts \u2014 including career fairs, increased marketing and new recruitment strategies honed by an outside consultant \u2014 unable to keep up. About 3,000 workers retired from the Bureau of Prisons last year and another 3,000 are expected to head for the door this year, Shane Fausey, the president of the federal correctional workers union, told the Judiciary Committee. Peters also faces other challenges, including modernizing facilities that are rotting with mold or literally falling apart. Others are in dire need of HVAC upgrades and other structural repairs. All told, the agency is facing a $2 billion infrastructure deficit, Peters said. Responding to an array of questions about the AP\u2019s reporting on rampant sexual abuse at a women\u2019s prison in California, Peters vowed to continue to prioritize allegations of staff misconduct and encouraged those who see wrongdoing to bring it forward. The Justice Department is also pushing for additional prosecutions and harsher penalties for prison workers who sexually abuse inmates. Peters said the agency must \u201ccreate an environment where people feel comfortable coming forward\u201d as whistleblowers \u2014 where inmates are free to speak up without retaliation and employees understand that they have an obligation to report wrongdoing. Peters agreed without hesitation when Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., asked if \u201cthe buck will stop with you\u201d and if she will bear \u201cpersonal and ultimate responsibility for what happens\u201d at the agency. Peters reiterated that afterward, telling the AP: \u201cThe buck stops with me. It\u2019s important that I understand what\u2019s happening inside our organization.\u201d The AP reported in February thatwhistleblower employees said they were being bulledby high-ranking prison officials, while inmates alleging abuse were being sent to solitary confinement or transferred to other prisons to silence them. Abill introduced Wednesdaywould require the Justice Department to hire an ombudsman to field and investigate such complaints. The measure has support from a broad coalition of prison stakeholders, including Fausey\u2019s union. \u201cA safe work place is a safe place for offenders to live. We have a common goal. Unfortunately, the Bureau of Prisons is a very large bureaucracy. If you do not maintain an independent avenue for oversight, a bureaucracy will abuse itself and I think the bureau has gotten to that point where they can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d Fausey said. Durbin, whose been a sharp critic of the Bureau of Prisons and its former director, Michael Carvajal, came away impressed with Peters, telling her: \u201cA-plus. You did very well.\u201d Durbin said in an interview with the AP that Peters \u201chas the right attitude about bringing a new generation of leadership to the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d \u201cShe has her hands full,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI want to be supportive of her in the administration. But I also want to hold them accountable.\u201d ___ On Twitter, follow Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Michael Balsamo at twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/",

        "By MICHAEL KUNZELMANSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A jury was selected Thursday in the seditious conspiracy case against the founder of the Oath Keepers extremist group and four associates in the highest profile prosecution stemming from theCapitol riotto reach a trial. A panel of 12 jurors and four alternates was chosen after three days of questioning about their feelings concerning the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and potential biases against the far-right groupaccused of plotting to use force to stop the transfer of presidential power. Opening statements are expected to begin Monday in federal court in the case againstStewart Rhodesand his associates \u2014 the first Jan. 6 defendants to go to trial on the Civil War-era charge ofseditious conspiracy. The stakes are high for the Justice Department,which will try to prove that Rhodes spent weeks rallying his followers to prepare to use violence in a desperate bid to keep Republican Donald Trump in the White House. If convicted of seditious conspiracy, they could face up to 20 years behind bars. Court records show the Oath Keepers, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, discussing paramilitary training and setting up a \u201cquick reaction force\u201d that could get weapons into Washington quickly if they were needed. Oath Keepers stashed weapons for the \u201cquick reaction force\u201d at a Virginia hotel and equipped themselves with communication devices, helmets, vests and other battle gear before storming the Capitol with the large mob of angry Trump supporters, prosecutors say. Rhodes is not accused of going inside the Capitol, but telephone records show he was communicating with Oath Keepers who did enter around the time of the riot and he was seen with members outside afterward. Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell face several other charges in addition to seditious conspiracy. Drawing from an original pool of 150 potential jurors, the judge and lawyers individually questioned about half of them over three days. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta disqualified dozens of the prospective jurors, mainly based on concerns about whether they could be fair and impartial. Thomas Caldwell\u2019s lawyer, David Fischer, asked many of the prospective jurors for their opinions about supporters of former President Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the allegiance to him,\u201d said a woman who is an elementary school principal. The judge rejected defense lawyers\u2019 request to dismiss her. One of the many lawyers from the jury pool described Trump\u2019s die-hard supporters as \u201cmisinformed\u201d and referred to the Jan. 6 attack as an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d The judge disqualified him. A few of the jurors are federal government employees, including a patent lawyer, a Transportation Security Administration program analyst and a man who works for the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The GAO worker said he attended two Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd\u2019s killing by a police officer in Minneapolis. He said he has a \u201cnegative impression\u201d of the Oath Keepers but believes he could be impartial. Another juror is a man who works in human resources for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and owned a home on Capitol Hill. He said his father is a Trump supporter. He also said one of his neighbors is U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui, who sits in the court where this trial is being held and often presides over hearings for Jan. 6 criminal cases. A juror who works for the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said he doesn\u2019t closely follow politics, adding, \u201cI find the whole thing relatively distasteful.\u201d Someone else chosen for the jury works as a health care consultant and said he has close friends who are Trump supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people did what they did on January 6th,\u201d he said. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said his defense will focus on their client\u2019s belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act and call up a militia to support his bid to stay in power. Rhodes\u2019 lawyers have said they will tell jurors that he is not guilty of seditious conspiracy because his actions in anticipation of what he believed would have been lawful orders from Trump under the Insurrection Act. His lawyers have said the \u201cquick reaction force\u201d outside Washington was meant for defensive purposes if Trump did so. Lawyers for the other Oath Keepers have said they came to Washington only to provide security for figures such as Trump ally Roger Stone at events before the riot. Nearly 900 people have been charged so far in the Jan. 6 riot and more than 400 have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. Sentences for the rioters so far have ranged from probation for low-level misdemeanor offenses to 10 years in prison for a retired New York City police officer who used a metal flagpole to assault an officer at the Capitol. ___ For full coverage of the Capitol riot, go to https://www.apnews.com/capitol-siege",

    "1/6 chairman: Ginni Thomas reiterates false election claims": [
        "By FARNOUSH AMIRI and MICHAEL BALSAMOSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, stood by the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent during an interview Thursday with the House committee investigatingthe Jan. 6 insurrection, the panel\u2019s chairman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told reporters after the more than four-hour interview ended. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re glad she came.\u201d The committee \u2014 comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 has for months sought an interview with Thomas in an effort to know more abouther role in trying to help former President Donald Trumpoverturn his election defeat. The conservative activist texted with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and contacted lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election. Thomas answered some of the questions from congressional investigators Thursday as she sought to portray herself as among the many Americans who still believe the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. But she did not provide any evidence or specific reasoning to back up her belief, the person said. \u201cAs she has said from the outset, Mrs. Thomas had significant concerns about fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election,\u201d Mark Paoletta, her attorney, said in a statement. \u201cAnd, as she told the Committee, her minimal and mainstream activity focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated.\u201d \u201cBeyond that, she played no role in any events after the 2020 election results,\u201d he added. The testimony from Thomas was one of the last remaining for the panel as it eyes the completion of its work. The panel has already interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and shown some of that video testimony in its eight hearings over the summer. The extent of her involvement in the Capitol attack is unclear. In the days after The Associated Press and other news organizations called the presidential election for Biden, Thomasemailed two lawmakers in Arizonato urge them to choose \u201ca clean slate of Electors\u201d and \u201cstand strong in the face of political and media pressure.\u201d The AP obtained the emails earlier this year under the state\u2019s open records law. She has said in previous interviews that she attended the initial pro-Trump rally the morning of Jan. 6 but left before Trump spoke and the crowds headed for the Capitol. Thomas, a Trump supporterlong active in conservative causes, has repeatedly maintained that her political activities posed no conflict of interest with the work of her husband. \u201cLike so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles, and aspirations for America. But we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn\u2019t discuss his work with me, and I don\u2019t involve him in my work,\u201d Thomas told the Washington Free Beacon in an interview published in March. Justice Thomas wasthe lone dissenting voicewhen the Supreme Court ruled in January to allow a congressional committee access to presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts and handwritten notes relating to the events of Jan. 6. Ginni Thomas has been openly critical of the committee\u2019s work, including signing onto a letter to House Republicans calling for the expulsion of Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois from the GOP conference for joining the Jan. 6 congressional committee. ___ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro and Eric Tucker and video journalist Rick Gentilo contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the Jan. 6 insurrection at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege",

    "Trump records probe: Tensions flare over special master": [
        "By ERIC TUCKERSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The parallel special master process spawned by the FBI search ofDonald Trump\u2019s Florida estatehas slowedthe Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigationand exposed simmering tensions between department prosecutors and lawyers for the former president. As the probe into the presence oftop-secret information at Mar-a-Lagocontinues, barbed comments in recent court filings have laid bare deep disagreements related to the special master\u2019s work \u2014 not just among lawyers but judges, too. And the filings have made clear that a process the Trump team initially asked for has not consistently played to the ex-president\u2019s advantage. A look at where things stand: WHO IS THE SPECIAL MASTER AND WHAT IS HIS ROLE? A federal judge in Floridaappointed at the Trump team\u2019s requestan independent arbiter to inspect the thousands of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago and to weed out from the investigation any that might be protected by claims of either attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. That arbiter, formally known as a special master, is Raymond Dearie. He\u2019s a former federal prosecutor who was appointed a U.S. District judge in Brooklyn by then-President Ronald Reagan. He also has served on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He was initially tasked by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, with reviewing all of the records taken from Mar-a-Lago. But a federal appeals court shrunk the scope of his duties last week, ruling that the Justice Department did not have to share with him the roughly 100 documents with classified markings that were taken during the Aug. 8 search. That leaves for his evaluation theroughly 11,000 other, unclassified documents\u2014 which a Trump lawyer said actually total roughly 200,000 pages \u2014 recovered by the FBI. Cannon, meanwhile, has also reined in some of Dearie\u2019s work. WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN REGARDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS? The past week has revealed stark divisions in how both sides envision the process playing out, as well as the precise role the special master should have. An early hint surfacedwhen the Trump team resisted Dearie\u2019s requestfor any information to support the idea that the documents had been declassified, as Trump has repeatedly asserted. A lawyer for Trump, James Trusty, said that inquiry was \u201cpremature\u201d and \u201ca little beyond\u201d what Cannon had in mind at the time she appointed the special master. The following day, in a setback for the Trump team, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit overruled an order from Cannon that had temporarily halted the Justice Department\u2019s ability to use the seized classified documents in its probe. Besidesrestoring the department\u2019s access,the order also lifted Cannon\u2019s mandate that investigators give the special master those records. More conflict followed, this time related to the scanning and processing of non-classified government records that were seized. Government lawyersrevealed in a letter Tuesdaythat none of the five document-review vendors they had recommended for the job was \u201cwilling to be engaged\u201d by the Trump team. The Justice Department said it was confident it would be able to secure the arrangements on its own while noting that it continued to expect the Trump team to pay. But Trusty respondedwith his own letter Wednesdayattributing the difficulty in securing a vendor to the sheer quantity of documents, which he said totaled roughly 200,000 pages \u2014 a number the Justice Department has not itself stated in court filings. He said the department\u2019s deadlines for the production of documents was overly \u201caggressive\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt would be better to base deadlines on actual data and not wistful claims by the Government,\u201d he noted at one point \u2014 and scolded the department for what he said were \u201cantagonistic\u201d comments. \u201cDOJ continues to mistake itself as having judicial authority. Its comments are not argument, but proclamations designed to steamroll judicial oversight and the Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d Trusty wrote. WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NEXT? The FBI\u2019s investigation took a major step forward when the appeals court lifted Cannon\u2019s hold on its ability to scrutinize the seized classified documents as it evaluates whether Trump or anyone else should face criminal charges. Dearie\u2019s work as special master will continue alongside that probe, though there\u2019s little chance any action he takes at this point could substantially alter the outcome of the FBI investigation or affect major decisions that lie ahead. But early disagreements between Cannon and Dearie over the scope of his duties also bear watching. For instance, Cannon on Thursday overturned a directive from the special master that would have required the Trump team to say whether it had any objections to a detailed FBI property inventory cataloging all of the items agents removed from the home. That response could have been illuminating given that Trump and some of his allies have raised unsupported suggestions that the agents who searched his home may have planted evidence. If his lawyers were to affirm the inventory\u2019s accuracy, they would likely be contradicting their own client\u2019s claims while also acknowledging the presence of classified materials in the home. The Justice Departmentthis week made what it called minor revisions to the inventory, but said it was an otherwise full and accurate accounting of what was taken. Yet newly disclosed correspondence showed the Trump team balking at being forced to assess the inventory\u2019s accuracy. Trusty said in a letter Sunday that the directive that it do so goes beyond what Cannon had envisioned when she appointed Dearie. Cannon herself agreed, canceling Dearie\u2019s requirement Thursday and writing that her \u201cappointment order did not contemplate that obligation.\u201d The Justice Department, for its part, had earlier suggested that the Trump team should not be able to avoid stating its position on the record or following other of Dearie\u2019s directives. \u201cThe Special Master needs to know that he is reviewing all of the materials seized from Mara-Lago on August 8, 2022 \u2014 and no additional materials \u2014 before he categorizes the seized documents and adjudicates privilege claims,\u201d the department said in one filing. The letter Tuesday ended with this tart reminder to Trump and his lawyers: \u201cPlaintiff brought this civil, equitable proceeding. He bears the burden of proof.\u201d ____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",

    "High stakes for O\u2019Rourke in Texas governor\u2019s debate Friday": [
        "By PAUL J. WEBERSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014Beto O\u2019Rourkespent his 50th birthday this week behind the wheel of his pickup in Texas, fast approaching a big moment in his uphill climb for governor. While a road trip through college campuses showed how the Democrat continues to draw big crowds \u2014 a photo line at the University of Texas snaked across an outdoor plaza in 90-degree heat \u2014 O\u2019Rourke is still trying to close in onRepublican Gov. Greg Abbottwith six weeks until Election Day, Nov. 8. That raises the stakes for O\u2019Rourke on Friday night in his only debate against Abbott, who has tried torefocus the race to his hard-line immigration measureson the U.S.-Mexico border as anger in Texas over a newabortion banand theUvalde school massacrecontinues flaring. With early voting set to begin in just over three weeks, some O\u2019Rourke supporters are looking for significant swings during the debate, which the former 2020 presidential candidate knows better than mostcan leave a lasting impression. \u201cHere\u2019s the way I see it: Most Texans are just beginning to tune into this election,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in an interview. The Democrat emphasized that Abbott started running television spots before his campaign, which has pulled in at least $30 million and has put the two-term governorin the rare position of being outraised. Abbott, who wants to stomp out Democrats\u2019 latest attempt to flip America\u2019s biggest Republican-led state, isn\u2019t ready to say this may be his tightest race. \u201cThis game ain\u2019t over yet, and we\u2019ll see how close it is when all is said and done,\u201d he told reporters this month. Like many Democrats running in November, O\u2019Rourke is drawing on outrage over abortion access and mass shootings, issues that have energized voters elsewhere. But as Texas Democrats also know, those same issues have failed to carry them in past elections. A new Texas abortion ban is threatening GOP support with women and hasalready caused stumbles for Abbottover unpopular restrictions that makeno exceptions for rape victims.The Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers has also elevated emotions in the race, withgrieving parents scolding Abbottand O\u2019Rourkeswearing at a hecklerwho laughed over gun control. O\u2019Rourke, shrugging off recent polls that showed him trailing, pointed to traditionally conservative Kansasrejecting an abortion banand Democrats winning special congressional elections in New York and Alaska as a sign of a shift in the electorateheading into November\u2019s midterms. To say O\u2019Rourke has been here before would be true of just about anywhere in Texas. Just as he did in hisbreakthrough U.S. Senate campaign in 2018, O\u2019Rourke has spent months visiting nearly every corner of the almost 800-mile-wide state, driving into the most strongly Republican counties in an effort to weaken the wall of rural support that has helped the GOP offset losses in booming big cities and suburbs. He stunned both parties four years ago by finishing within 3 percentage points of unseating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. In the governor\u2019s race, O\u2019Rourke has run a more attacking campaign but also has been forced to confront his past positions, none more than his promise to ban AR-15-style weapons during a Democratic presidential debate in 2019. In the aftermath of the Uvalde shooting, O\u2019Rourke has called to raise the minimum age to purchase such weapons to 21, something Abbotthas already ruled out. \u201cIf Beto can coax Abbott into a moment where there\u2019s a stark difference on, say, gun control I think that can have a big impact,\u201d said Jason Villalba, a former Republican state lawmaker. \u201cBut to do that you have to be aggressive and take large risks.\u201d Villalba, who now runs the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation, said O\u2019Rourke has had to overcome \u201cbaggage\u201d from his presidential campaign. Villalba believes the fortunes of the former El Paso congressman are in the hands of newly registered women voters and whether he can close the gap in rural counties. Friday\u2019s debate is in Edinburg, along the southern border, where Abbott and Republicans are trying to make aggressive inroads with Hispanic voters after the region, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, made big swings toward then-President Donald Trump in 2020. It will be the first time the two candidates have been face to face since O\u2019Rourkeconfronted Abbott in Uvalde after the shooting, which drew a mix of boos and cheers from the crowd at the time. \u201cI think he just feels like, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough\u2019 and we all feel that way,\u201d said Mary Zambrano, 32, who dropped in to see O\u2019Rourke at an Austin gymnasium on Saturday. \u201cAt this point, you have to go all in.\u201d ___ Associated Press writer Acacia Coronado contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Prosecutors use emails to build case against key Trump ally": [
        "By TOM HAYSSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prosecutors cracked open a trove of emails and other communications ata federal trialon Thursday that they say shows how the former chair of Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee worked behind the scenes in 2016 to get the future president to embrace the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Some of the email traffic was between Tom Barrack \u2014 accused of working at the direction of the UAE as a secret foreign agent \u2014 andPaul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time. The exchanges focused in part over an energy policy speech by Trump in 2016. In one email read to the jury by an FBI agent, Barrack complained to Manafort that an original draft of the speech didn\u2019t mention either the UAE or Saudi Arabia, or the importance of their role in the Middle East. \u201cWow. I\u2019m just stunned by how bad this is,\u201d the billionaire private equity manager wrote about the draft. Manafort responded: \u201cSend me an insert that works for our friends.\u201d The speech Trump gave ended up referring to the need to team with \u201cour supportive Gulf allies\u201d as part of a broader strategy to fight terrorism in the region. Afterward, Barrack received an email from a UAE official congratulating him for doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d In other emails, Manafort assured those in the back-channel network that he would get Trump to tone down his anti-Muslim rhetoric and that he would set up face-to-face meetings between Trump and UAE and Saudi leaders. Another Barrack email indicated he had lobbied Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner on Manafort\u2019s behalf to get Manafort the campaign manager post. Manafort was eventually convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and later pardoned by Donald Trump. Prosecutors say the communications demonstrate Barrack\u2019s efforts to manipulate the Trump campaign and later his administration to advance the interests of the UAE. They say at the same time, the energy-rich Gulf state poured millions of dollars into business ventures operated by Barrack. Barrack, 75, has pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, obstruction of justice and making false statements. In his opening statements this week, defense attorney Steven Schachter insisted there was no evidence that Barrack ever took orders from the UAE or betrayed his country by becoming a covert agent. \u201cTom Barrack is his own man,\u201d the lawyer said.",

    "EPA doubles money for electric school buses as demand soars": [
        "By MATTHEW DALYSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Responding to \u201coverwhelming demand,\u201d the Environmental Protection Agency is nearly doubling the money available to states to buy electric models of the familiar yellow school buses that millions of children ride every school day. The EPA made $500 million available for clean buses in May, but is increasing that to $965 million for districts across the country. An additional $1 billion is expected to be available in the budget year that begins Saturday. In the current year, the agency said it has received about 2,000 applications requesting nearly $4 billion for more than 12,000 buses, mostly electric. \u201cAmerica\u2019s school districts delivered this message loud and clear: We must replace older, dirty diesel school buses,\u2033 EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Thursday. \u201cTogether, we can reduce climate pollution, improve air quality and reduce the risk of health impacts like asthma for as many as 25 million children who ride the bus every day.\u201d Only about 1% of the nation\u2019s 480,000 school buses were electric as of last year, but the push to abandon diesel buses has gained momentum in recent years. Money for the new purchases is available under the agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program, which includes $5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law President Joe Biden signed last year. School districts from all 50 states have applied for rebates under the program, which aims to replace traditional diesel school buses with low- and zero-emission models in the next five years. EPA said it will move swiftly to review applications submitted and expects to grant awards next month. EPA Administrator Regan said the accelerated time frame for the grants was a result of especially strong demand. The Biden administration is \u201cworking across all 50 states to accelerate the transition to a future where clean, zero-emissions school buses are the American standard,\u201d he said. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he was pleased to see high demand for electric school buses, including in low-income, tribal and other disadvantaged communities. \u201cThese are the very communities that stand to gain the most from our historic clean school bus investments in the bipartisan infrastructure law,\u2033 Carper said. Given the strong response from states and local school districts, \u201cit\u2019s clear that more funding is needed ... so that more communities can realize the clean air and energy saving benefits of these cleaner vehicles,\u201d he said. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called the additional grant funding \u201ca huge win for our nation\u2019s children and our fight against the climate crisis.\u2033 The current rebate application period under the EPA program closed in August. More than 90% of applications were for zero-emission electric buses, with about 9% for propane-fueled buses and 1% for compressed natural gas buses, also called CNG. The Clean School Bus Program is intended to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollution. Pollution from diesel fumes is linked to asthma and other health conditions that cause students to miss school. \u201cWith applications flooding the Clean School Bus Program, school districts around the country have spoken: They\u2019re ready to make polluting diesel buses a thing of the past,\u2033 said Sue Gander, director of an electric school bus initiative for the World Resources Institute, a global research organization. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re entering a new, electric era in student transportation, one with massive benefits for our kids\u2019 health, climate and the economy,\u201d Gander said. The National Education Association, which represents teachers and other school professionals, welcomed the push for cleaner school buses, but said more must be done to improve school bus safety. \u201cWe are thrilled about the new technology and cleaner fuel with these state-of-the-art buses,\u201d said NEA senior policy analyst Tim Barchak. \u201cBut in terms of transporting your kids, that\u2019s half the equation. We want them to have the best drivers ... and the more we professionalize and stabilize the bus driver position, the better it is for kids.\u201d",

        "By ZEKE MILLER and DARLENE SUPERVILLESeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday said \u201cour entire country hurts\u201d along with the people of Florida afterHurricane Ianflooded communities across the state, knocked out power, forced people into shelters and raised fears of a \u201csubstantial loss of life.\u201d Biden said the storm could end up as the \u201cdeadliest hurricane in Florida\u2019s history.\u201d During a visit to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where he was briefed on federal response efforts, the president said, \u201cThe numbers are still unclear, but we\u2019re hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life.\u201d Biden said he would visit Florida and meet with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis when \u201cconditions allow.\u201d The president said he would also visit Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, that was slammed earlier this month byHurricane Fiona. \u201cWe know many families are hurting,\u201d Biden said at FEMA\u2019s National Response Coordination Center, where teams of specialists from across the federal government and partner organizations were monitoring the storm and assisting in recovery efforts. \u201cOur entire country hurts with them.\u2032 He urged those affected by Ian to take seriously the warnings from local officials to stay safe and remain indoors. \u201cDon\u2019t go outside unless you have to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe danger is real, to state the obvious. Please obey all warnings and direction from emergency officials.\u201d Biden and DeSantis spoke before the hurricane hit and again Thursday morning as the destruction began to come into focus. Ian made landfall as one of the strongest hurricanes ever in the United States. The storm flooded homes on Florida\u2019s coasts, cut off the only bridge to a barrier island, destroyed a historic waterfront pier and knocked out electricity to 2.67 million homes and businesses. At least one man was confirmed dead. Biden declared a major disaster in parts of Florida early Thursday at DeSantis\u2019 request, freeing up additional federal assistance to state and local governments and individuals. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said more counties would likely be added to the disaster declaration as assessments were carried out. Asked if his administration would need additional money from Congress to respond to the storm, Biden said, \u201cWe may.\u201d Biden said DeSantis, with whom he has squabbled politically, was \u201cextremely happy\u201d with the federal response. The president said \u201cthis is not about anything having to do with our disagreements politically.

    "Senate passes stopgap bill to avert shutdown, aid Ukraine": [
        "By KEVIN FREKINGSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Thursday that would avert a partial government shutdown when the current fiscal year ends at midnight Friday and provide another infusion of military and economic aid to Ukraine as it seeks torepel Russia\u2019s brutal invasion. The bill finances the federal government through Dec. 16 and buys lawmakers more time to agree on legislation setting spending levels for the 2023 fiscal year. It passed by a vote of 72-25 and now goes to the House for consideration. All of the no votes came from Republicans. As has become routine, lawmakers waited until the final hours before the shutdown deadline to act. But passage of a bill to fund the government was hardly in doubt, particularly afterDemocrat Sen. Joe Manchinagreed to drop provisions designed to streamline the permitting process for energy projects and greenlight the approval of apipeline in his home state of West Virginia.Those provisions had drawn opposition from both sides of the political aisle. Still, the bill merely puts off for a few months the maneuvering that will be required after themidterm electionto pass a massive government funding package, as negotiators will have to bridge their differences over spending on hot-button issues such as abortion, border security and climate change. The bill approved Thursday, with some exceptions, keeps spending at federal agencies at current levels through mid-December. The most notable of those exceptions is the more than $12 billion that will be provided to aid Ukraine, on top of more than $50 billion provided in two previous bills. The money will go to provide training, equipment and logistics support for the Ukraine military, help Ukraine\u2019s government provide basic services to its citizens and replenish U.S. weapons systems and munitions. \u201cSeven months since the conflict began, it\u2019s crystal clear that American assistance has gone a long way to helping the Ukrainian people resist (Russian President Vladimir) Putin\u2019s evil, vicious aggression,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cBut the fight is far from over.\u201d Republican leader Mitch McConnell also voiced support for the Ukraine aid, while admonishing the Biden administration to get it out the door more quickly. \u201cAssisting Ukraine is not some feel-good, symbolic gesture,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally an investment in our own national security and that of our allies.\u201d Disaster assistance was attached to the stopgap bill, including $2.5 billion to help New Mexico communities recover from theHermit\u2019s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire,the largest wildfire in the state\u2019s history; $2 billion for a block grant program that aids the economic recovery of communities impacted by recent disasters and$20 million for water and wastewater infrastructure improvements previously authorized for Jackson, Mississippi. An additional $18.8 billion was included for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to current and future disasters, such asHurricane Ian, which hit Florida on Wednesday. The bill would provide an additional $1 billion for a program that helps low-income households heat their homes. And it would transfer $3 billion from a Pentagon aid program to the State Department for continued Afghan resettlement operations. Lawmakers also included a reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s user fee agreements for five years, which ensures the agency can continue critical product safety reviews and won\u2019t need to issue pink slips for thousands of employees working on drug and medical device applications. One thing missing from the bill is the billions of dollars in additional funding that President Joe Biden sought to aid the response toCOVID-19andmonkeypox.Republicans criticized the health spending as unnecessary. The White House said the money would have been used to accelerate the research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, prepare for future COVID variants and support the global response. The bill\u2019s passage is the last must-do item on lawmakers\u2019 list before returning to their home states and districts to campaign before the mid-term elections that will determine which party controls the House and Senate over the next two years. Lawmakers were anxious to get out of Washington and focus on campaigning without the specter of a shutdown. \u201cThe last thing the American people need right now is a pointless government shutdown,\u201d Schumer said.",

    "Case against source for Trump dossier advances, barely": [
        "By MATTHEW BARAKATSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 A judge is allowing prosecutors to move forward with their criminal case against an analyst who provided key details for a flawed dossier on ex-President Donald Trump, although the judge called his decision \u201can extremely close call.\u201d Lawyers for Igor Danchenko asked a judge Thursday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria to dismiss all five charges against him. He\u2019saccused of lying to the FBIabout how he obtained the information that ultimately made its way into the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d a report that purported to detail connections between Trump and Russian intelligence and helped fuel a full-fledged FBI investigation called \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d in the months leading up to the 2016 election. The dossier famously suggested that Russians had compromising information on Trump regarding salacious sexual activity he allegedly engaged in at a Moscow hotel. The indictment alleges Danchenko lied about the credibility of his sources when in reality his primary source was actually a Democratic operative named Charles Dolan with ties to Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton. The indictment says the FBI could have better judged the veracity of the Steele dossier had it known that a Democratic operative who volunteered for Clinton was the source of much of the dossier\u2019s information. Danchenko\u2019s lawyers argued Thursday that all the charges should be dismissed because Danchenko\u2019s answers to the FBI were technically true, if not necessarily illuminating. Specifically, Danchenko denied that he \u201ctalked\u201d to Dolan about the allegations in the dossier. In reality, Danchenko had discussed the accusations in an email with Dolan, but never spoke with him in an oral conversation. \u201cIt was a bad question,\u201d said Danchenko\u2019s lawyer, Stuart Sears. \u201cThat\u2019s the special counsel\u2019s problem. Not Mr. Danchenko\u2019s. ... He is not required to guess what the question actually means.\u201d The other counts deal with a statement to the FBI that Danchenko received other details in an anonymous phone call from someone he \u201cbelieved\u201d to be Sergei Millian, a former president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. Sears said Danchenko never said with any certainty that Millian was the source and that it can\u2019t be a false statement if that was what Danchenko truly believed. Special Counsel John Durham, who wasappointed in 2019 by then-Attorney General William Barrto look for government misconduct in the \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d investigation, said that Danchenko\u2019s statements, if examined in context rather than in isolation, will show that he knowingly lied. He said Danchenko himself used the word \u201cspeaking\u201d to refer written words posted on social media accounts. And he said the evidence will show Millian didn\u2019t know Danchenko and that Danchenko had no reason to believe that Millian was the anonymous caller that Danchenko cited. \u201cHe knows exactly what the FBI is looking for, the context of those questions,\u201d Durham said. The judge, Anthony Trenga, acknowledged that the defense\u2019s theory \u201ccan be a very persuasive, strong argument to a jury,\u201d but he said that ultimately the government met its burden to overcome a motion to dismiss. It will be up to a jury to determine whether the government can meet its burden of proving a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, a much higher standard. Trenga said he will revisit the issue during trial after the government presents its case. The most incendiary allegations in the Steele dossier \u2014 that Trump hired prostitutes to engage in sexual activity in the presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow \u2014 may not be part of the trial at all. Danchenko is not actually charged with lying to the FBI about his sourcing for that specific allegation. But prosecutors want to present evidence to the jury about it nonetheless, and elicit testimony that would suggest Dolan was Danchenko\u2019s source for that allegation as well. Defense lawyers say any testimony about it is irrelevant and prejudicial and threatens to \u201cswallow the trial\u201d if it\u2019s allowed in. Prosecutor Michael Keilty countered that it\u2019s important to show Dolan\u2019s connection to those allegations. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a sideshow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about what Mr. Trump did or did not do at the Ritz.\u201d Trenga took the issue under advisement \u2014 he said he had concerns about the relevancy of the information compared to its potential for prejudice, and that he would rule on that and other issues of what evidence will be allowed at trial before it begins Oct. 11.",

    "US sanctions traders of Iranian oil as nuclear talks stall": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. on Thursday imposed sanctions on a group of firms it says have played a critical role in shipping sanctioned Iranian oil. The State Department designated two Chinese companies, and Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control hit a network of companies based in Hong Kong, Iran, India and the United Arab Emirates. U.S. sanctions on Iran have accelerated in recent months, as administration officials try to bring Tehran back to negotiations for a return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Sanctions wereimposed in July on a group of firmstied to the sale and shipment of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products to East Asia. \u201cSo long as Iran refuses a mutual return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the United States will continue to enforce its sanctions on the sale of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products,\u201d said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson. The administration uses an August 2018executive ordersigned by then-President Donald Trump as its authority to impose the sanctions. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has been working to renew the nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2018. The agreement placed curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, which Iran insists it never received. In addition, the U.S. has taken steps to punish Iran\u2019s government after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She was detained this month by the morality police, who said she didn\u2019tproperly cover her hairwith the mandatory Islamic headscarf, known as the hijab. Amini collapsed at a police station and died three days later. Her death set off protests in dozens of cities across the country, and the government responded with a fierce crackdown. An Associated Press count of official statements by authorities tallied at least 14 dead, with more than 1,500 demonstrators arrested. The U.S. imposed sanctions on the morality police and the leaders of other Iranian law enforcement agencies, denying them access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S.",

    "US candidate to lead UN telecoms agency after US-Russia race": [
        "By STEPHEN McGRATH and JAMEY KEATENSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the United States was elected Thursday to head the U.N.\u2019s telecommunications agency, winning a U.S.-Russia face-off for the leadership of a global agency that sets guideposts for radio, internet, satellite and television communications. Envoys from the 193 member states of the Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union selected Bogdan-Martin over lone rival Rashid Ismailov of Russia, ending a contest that was largely overshadowed by geopolitics in the wake ofRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Members of the agency\u2019s policy-making body meeting in Romania\u2019s capital voted 139-25 with a number of abstentions in favor of naming the first woman as ITU secretary-general and the first American to hold the post since the 1960s. Bogdan-Martin, who will begin her four-year term as ITU secretary-general on Jan. 1, is a 29-year ITU veteran and the current director of its telecommunication development bureau. Her career began in the U.S. Commerce Department. Speaking in the plenary hall in Bucharest after her election, Bogdan-Martin described the leadership position as \u201can immensely important position\u201d and said it will be an \u201chonor for me and my country\u201d to lead the organization. \u201cI hope this day will be an inspiration for other women to follow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to deliver affordable, trusted, and meaningful connectivity to all. Universal connectivity has been a dream for far too many years \u2014 let\u2019s unite and make it real.\u201d Ismailov, 57, is a former deputy telecommunications minister in Russia and a former executive in telecom companies such as Eriksson, Nokia and Huawei. Before Thursday\u2019s vote, both candidates touted expanding connectivity to the internet and the benefits of information and communication technology, or ICT, to roughly half the world that still has no access. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, alluding to the Biden administration\u2019s support for Bodgan-Martin, hailed a broad international endorsement of her vision for \u201cuniversal connectivity, digital empowerment, and leadership at the ITU that is innovative, collaborative, and inclusive.\u201d \u201cWe have made clear since the earliest days of the administration that American leadership in multilateral venues, including the United Nations, is crucial to ensuring the international community is best positioned to address our shared challenges,\u201d Blinken said. David Gross, a former State Department official now with the Wiley law firm in Washington, said Bodgan-Martin\u2019s margin of victory showed much of the world rejects \u201cthe Russian approach regarding government \u2018top-down\u2019 control of technology\u201d and said her challenges would now include finding \u201ccommon ground among competing approaches\u201d and \u201ccreative ways to connect the unconnected.\u201d The ITU, whose history dates to 1865, is among the oldest U.N. specialized agencies and predates the United Nations itself by 80 years. The agency has its roots among countries that coordinated over the development of the telegraph, a forebear of the high-tech telecommunications of today. The agency\u2019s main tasks now are setting out a \u201cdigital transformation\u201d for the 21st century \u2014 as outgoing Secretary-General Houlin Zhao put it \u2014 and setting out standards for telecommunications and regulating the development of technologies like 5G networks. U.S. officials were eager to recapture the post amid news reports and allegations from experts suggesting that Zhao, a former government official in China, was too cozy with Beijing and promotional of Chinese interests and technology standards during his two terms as ITU chief. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, which has put Moscow on the diplomatic defensive, led some countries to think twice about handing a top U.N. post to a former member of Russian government. Ismailov has alluded to the pressure Russia has faced \u2014 including in Geneva diplomatic circles that are home to many U.N. institutions like the ITU. Also weighing over Ismailov\u2019s bid were concerns that Russia\u2019s government has encouraged at worst -- or turned a blind eye to, at best - the use of the Internet and other telecommunications networks to disrupt activities of foreign companies, governments and civilians, if not spy on or monitor people at home. The United States also has come in for sharp criticism \u2013 notably from former National Security Agency contractorEdward Snowden, who fled to Russia to escape U.S. justice \u2013 over its own surveillance and spying on civilians and government officials. ___ Jamey Keaten reported from Geneva.",

    "Treasury moves forward with database on corporate ownership": [
        "By FATIMA HUSSEINSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tens of millions of small U.S. companies will be required to provide the government with details on their owners and others who benefit from them under a regulation finalized Thursday that\u2019s intended to peel back the layers of ownership that can hide unlawfully obtained assets. The Treasury Departmentsaid it was moving to create a database that will contain personal information on the owners of at least 32 million U.S. businesses as part of an effort to combat illicit finance. Treasury officials said the new rule represents a sea change in the world of corporate transparency. The regulation comes in the midst of U.S. and Western allies\u2019 ongoingattempts to sanction Russian oligarchsand wealthy friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of hisinvasion of Ukraine. The wealthy Russians are accused of hiding stolen money and assets in the U.S. and around the world. \u201cThis rule will make it harder for criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\u201d Treasury SecretaryJanet Yellensaid in a statement. \u201cIt will help strengthen our national security by making it more difficult for oligarchs, terrorists, and other global threats to use complex legal structures to launder money, traffic humans and drugs, and commit other crimes that threaten harm to the American people,\u201d she said. The rule will require most American businesses with fewer than 20 employees to register with the government as of Jan. 1, 2024. Treasury officials said the regulatory burden will be small, costing about $85 per business, but will offer massive benefits to law enforcement. Small businesses are targeted because shell companies, often used to hide illegally obtained assets, tend to have few employees. The rule requires reporting companies to disclose information on the people who own, control or create firms, including the name, birthdate, address and a unique identification number from driver\u2019s licenses or passports as well as images of the documents. The database will be available only to law enforcement and government agencies. Ian Gary, the executive director of the FACT Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes corporate transparency, called the release of the new rule \u201ca historic moment in the decadeslong fight to rid the U.S. of dirty money.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. has fallen behind many jurisdictions in requiring the true owners of corporate and other entities to be disclosed,\u201d Gary said. Gary said there is more work to be done to fully implement the rule. Treasury said it will pursue subsequent rulemakings that will address access to the database and other enhancements to the new regulation. The National Federation of Independent Businesses in February raised privacy concerns about the rule, saying that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is tasked with creating the database, must provide the same safeguards for the information that apply to other U.S. intelligence agencies. The regulation implements the reporting provisions of the Corporate Transparency Act, which was enacted as part ofthe National Defense Authorization Actfor fiscal 2021. Brian North, a business law attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll Rooney in Philadelphia, said the biggest impact of the database will be its use as a tool for helping law enforcement. \u201cIf an entity was being used to avoid sanctions,\u201d for example, he said, \u201cthe database would be used to provide information to the government to assist in its enforcement.\u201d ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of the Treasury Department athttps://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-the-treasury.",

    "States spend federal COVID aid on roads, buildings, seawalls": [
        "By DAVID A. LIEB and KAVISH HARJAISeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " Standing 14 stories tall, the Docking State Office Building is one of Kansas\u2019 largest and oldest state workplaces. It\u2019s also largely vacant, despite a prime location across from the Capitol. So Kansas officials are planning to spend $60 million of federal pandemic relief funds to help finance its demolition and replace it with a slimmed-down, three-story building designed to host meetings and events. State officials categorized the project as a \u201cpublic health service\u201d in a report to the U.S. Treasury Department laying out their plans for the money. Though that may be a stretch, it\u2019s likely fine underthe American Rescue Plan act\u2014 a sweeping law signed by President Joe Biden last year that providesbroad flexibility for $350 billion of aid to states and local governments. The aid was promoted by Democrats in Congress as an unprecedented infusion for cash-strapped governments to respond to the virus, rebuild their economies and shore up their finances. But it came as state tax revenues already were rebounding,leaving many states with record surplusesand enviable decisions about what to do with all the money. Relatively little of the federal aid has gone toward traditional public health purposes, according to an Associated Press review of reports filed by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Significantly more has gone toward public infrastructure. States are pouring money into water, sewer and high-speed internet projects, as specifically envisioned by the law. But the AP found that they\u2019re also spending billions of dollars on roads, bridges, sidewalks, airports, rail lines and buildings at college campuses and government agencies \u2014 justifying all of it under the federal government\u2019s generous flexibility. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need it, to be quite honest,\u201d said Kansas House Appropriations Committee Chairman Troy Waymaster, referring to the $1.6 billion the state received. But the Docking building does need to come down, he said, and the new space for events and meetings could allow better social distancing during a COVID-19 resurgence or future pandemic. If \u201cthe building itself could be used during a pandemic, then it somewhat justifies the use of ARPA funds for the renovation or infrastructure projects,\u201d said Waymaster, a Republican. A Kansas preservationist group hasasked a court to block the demolition, arguing that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t followed proper procedures to tear down the 65-year-old structure that was added to the National Register of Historic Places earlier this year. \u201cThere\u2019s some wrongheaded action going on here to demolish what really is a perfectly suitable building,\u201d said Paul Post, a retired Topeka attorney and member of the Plains Modern preservationist group. All states recently were required to file annual reports with the Treasury Department detailing their progress under the American Rescue Plan. The documents show states have planned expenditures for about three-fourths of their funds. up significantly froman initial slow pace. The Treasury asked states to classify projects in seven general categories, with 83 subcategories. It can recoup funds if it determines by the end of 2026 that spending fell outside the law\u2019s wide guidelines. Governments reported more than $22 billion of planned expenditures for the Treasury\u2019s infrastructure category of water, sewer and broadband. But the AP identified a total of about $36 billion for infrastructure projects \u2014 nearly one-quarter of all planned expenditures \u2014 when including roads, bridges, buildings and public works projects reported in other categories. By contrast, governments reported less than $12 billion of planned expenditures in the Treasury\u2019s public health category \u2014 even though it was broadly construed to also include such things as \u201ccommunity violence interventions,\u201d substance use services and COVID-19 aid to small businesses. Some state officials may have decided not to use the relief funds for public health because they had other federal funding streams for vaccines, testing and health initiatives. For example, a separate section of the American Rescue Plan provided nearly $8 billion for state and local health departments. But the large influx of funds may also have stirred concerns about sustainability. Thoughpublic health has historically been underfunded, \u201ca lot of health officials have struggled to get their policymakers and their bosses to commit to hiring people for the long-term because it\u2019s one-time money,\u201d said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. Some states reported no public health expenditures with their discretionary American Rescue Plan funds. Those included Florida, which received the fourth largest allotment from the federal government. Florida instead devoted $1.8 billion for highway, $1.9 billion for water projects and more than $2.5 billion for construction and maintenance of public buildings, including the Capitol, university facilities and K-12 schools, according to the AP\u2019s analysis. The state\u2019s water initiatives include up to $700 million for a grant program to fight flooding associated with climate change. The city of Miami was awarded about $50 million for a half-dozen projects, including one that will nearly double the height of a sea wall in an area devastated by a storm surge from Hurricane Irma in 2017. The goal of the project is \u201cto protect the residences and the businesses from future storm surge and sea level rise,\u201d said Sonia Brubaker, Miami\u2019s chief resilience officer. Louisiana also listed no planned expenditures in the Treasury\u2019s public health category. But the state plans to spend $863 million on roads and bridges, $750 million on water and sewer infrastructure and $27 million forimprovements to the domed stadiumwhere the New Orleans Saints play football. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards said the stadium subsidy was critical \u201cto keep that venue competitive.\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, also defended $46 million of grants to upgrade grandstands, walkways, bathrooms and infrastructure at racetracks across his state. \u201cMotorsports are part of the fabric of North Carolina,\u201d he said earlier this year. Alabama prisoners have sued the Treasury Departmentto try to stop the state from spending $400 million on prison construction. Though the state agues it\u2019s OK under the Treasury\u2019s flexible rules, the lawsuit contends it\u2019s a \u201ca gross and illegal misuse\u201d of pandemic relief funds. A coalition of more than two dozen construction, business and local government groups ispressing Congress to grant even more leewayto use pandemic aid on transportation projects. \u201cHaving a good infrastructure that allows us all to live and thrive\u201d ultimately \u201cleads back into public health,\u201d said Stan Brown, past president of the American Public Works Association. Missouri, which has yet to categorize most of its projects, also is investing heavily in infrastructure by directing hundreds of millions of dollars to buildings at community colleges and public universities. The NextGen Precision Health initiative at the University of Missouri will get nearly $105 million for improvements that include finishing off the fourth floor of a new building named for retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. \u201cA lot of this was already going to happen,\u201d although no specific timeline had been set, said university spokesperson Christian Basi. \u201cThen COVID hits, and then ARPA funds are available. It\u2019s coincidental odd timing, but it turned out to be a very, very helpful thing for us.\u201d Like Missouri, Utah categorized $90 million for a new mental health research facility as a replacement of lost revenue for government services. Construction is to begin next year on the building, which will host research on suicide and the effect of social isolation on children\u2019s mental health, among other things. The planned work aligns nicely with the intent of the federal aid, said Mark Rapaport, CEO of the Huntsman Mental Health Institute at the University of Utah. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019re doing is directly related to tackling issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic itself,\u201d he said. ___ Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri, and Harjai from Los Angeles.

Jackson was confirmedin April on a 53-47 vote in the Senate, with three Republican senators joining all Democrats to support her. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful thing when people can see themselves in others,\u201d Biden said ata South Lawn celebrationshortly after Jackson\u2019s springtime confirmation. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons I believed so strongly that we needed a court that looks like America.\u201d Aside from Jackson at the Supreme Court, the White House and the Democratic-led Senate have confirmed dozens of judges at the federal district and appellate levels, with candidates who have brought more racial and gender diversity to the courts. Of the 143 judicial nominations made by Biden, 68% have been women and 66% are people of color, according to the White House.

    "In Minnesota, abortion key to Keith Ellison\u2019s 2nd term hopes": [
        "By STEVE KARNOWSKISeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014Keith Ellisongave up a safe seat in Congress to run for Minnesota attorney general, saying it was his best chance to push back against the policies of Donald Trump. Now locked in a tough reelection fight, he\u2019s arguing that he\u2019s been far less of a partisan warrior than his critics claim. Ellison squeaked into office in 2018, taking a post that Democrats had traditionally won easily. But he was a polarizing figure in the eyes of some voters. The outspoken progressive came from the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, and Republicans tried to draw attention to his past associations with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, though Ellison had publicly renounced Farrakhan when he first ran for the U.S. House in 2006. His bid for a second term as attorney general comes after four tumultuous years that put Minnesota in the world spotlight over the police killings of George Floyd and other Black men. His Republican opponent,hedge fund lawyer Jim Schultz, says Ellison deserves much of the blame for the surge in violent crime that followed. To fight back, Ellison has used this summer\u2019s U.S. Supreme Courtdecision rolling back abortion rightstorally Democrats and suburban swing voters. He\u2019s also urged those voters to look at his work on more everyday issues such as affordable health care and prescription drugs, consumer and business fraud protections and protections for workers against wage theft \u2014 all things that belie his image, he said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m going to be a firebrand and I end up being a fairly pragmatic guy,\u201d Ellison said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s true of my entire service.\u201d Ellison wasalready leading a major initiative for greater police accountabilitywhen Floyd died under the knee of former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. Ellison went on tolead the prosecution team that got Chauvin convicted of murderthe next year, a verdict that potentially averted another eruption of violence. Ellison also took a step that his Republican critics are now trying to use against him. He strongly backed a charter amendment in Minneapolis thatarose from the \u201cdefund the police\u201dmovement. Itwould have replaced the city\u2019s police departmentwith a loosely defined department of public safety, with details to be worked out later.Voters rejectedit. On the campaign trail, Schultz depicts Ellison as being \u201cat the forefront of the defund-the-police movement\u201d and blames that movement for the departures of hundreds of dispirited police officers in Minneapolis and elsewhere. And he blames those losses for the spike in gun violence, carjackings and other crimes since the pandemic. \u201cFar left, extreme politicians like Keith Ellison have gotten behind really reckless policies like defunding the police,\u201d Schultz said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply wrong. It\u2019s immoral.\u201d Violent crime has been rising across Minnesotasince the pandemic began, with Minneapolis accounting for much of the increase, while its police force has fallen about 300 officers short of its authorized strength. Minnesota saw a 21.6% statewide increase in violent crime in 2021 from 2020, with violent crime in greater Minnesota rising by 16% and by 23.9% in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. Ellison said he doesn\u2019t regret supporting the charter amendment, but he said he never supported \u201cdefunding the police\u201d and said it didn\u2019t accurately describe the amendment. He also dismissed Schultz\u2019s claim that he\u2019s hostile to police, saying he regards policing as a noble profession and that Chauvin did more to invite scorn and demoralize officers than anything he ever did. \u201cI\u2019m the one whoprosecuted him for killingGeorge Floyd,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cSo I\u2019m the one trying to restore the honor and dignity of policing.\u201d Ellison alsoled the prosecution of former Brooklyn Center OfficerKim Potter, who said she confused her gun for her Taser when she killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop last year. She was convicted of manslaughter in December. Schultz has said he would support commuting her two-year sentence. Crime isn\u2019t the only issue that has Schultz, a 36-year-old political newcomer, hopeful of being the first Republican to occupy the attorney general\u2019s office since 1971. He also accuses Ellison of \u201cunbelievable incompetence\u201d for failing to stopa massive fraud schemein its early stages, with 49 people charged so far with stealing at least $250 million from federal programs administered by the state to provide low-income children with nutritious meals during the pandemic. Ellison has countered that his office helped uncover the fraud. If Ellison is to survive both that attack and the policing criticism to win a second term, abortion rights is likely to be the issue that does it. Schultz vowed this spring to do everything in his power as attorney general to aggressively defend the unborn. After Roe\u2019s reversal, he joined many other Republicans trying to pivot away from abortion and back to crime in a state where abortion rights are protected under the state constitution. Meanwhile, Ellison brought New York Attorney General Letitia James to Minnesota in early September to raise money from abortion rights supporters in the legal community. Soon after, he visited an abortion clinic in Moorhead that moved across the border from Fargo, North Dakota,to escape a trigger ban on abortion.Ellison vowed early on that his office won\u2019t cooperate if other states seek to prosecute women who come to Minnesota for abortions. Ellison said the election is about more than abortion rights or crime. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, theJan. 6 insurrection,the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision and the rise of\u201cMAGA Republicans\u201dhave put democracy in doubt, he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what we can\u2019t do,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell people we got this. Quite frankly, I\u2019m glad people see my race as close because it means they\u2019re going to show up.\u201d",

    "US seeks united front in Asia despite Korea, Japan tensions": [
        "By CHRIS MEGERIAN, MARI YAMAGUCHI and TONG-HYUNG KIMSeptember 29, 2022 GMT",
        " YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Standing on the deck of an American destroyer at a naval base here on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris directly challenged China by accusing it of \u201cdisturbing behavior\u201d and \u201cprovocations\u201d around Taiwan. Harris said the United States would in response \u201cdeepen our unofficial ties\u201d to the disputed island that China views as part of its territory. The escalating tensions over Taiwan have raised the potential for conflict in an already volatile corner of the globe. But the core of U.S. plans for deterring \u2014 or, if necessary, confronting \u2014 China depends on alliances that are under strain. South Korea and Japan, which Harris described as the\u201clinchpin\u201dand\u201ccornerstone\u201dof American strategy in Asia, remain at odds with each other, divided by the legacy of World War II despite renewed efforts at reconciliation. Japan colonized the Korean Peninsula years before the conflict began, sending many people into forced labor and women into sexual slavery. Decades later, tensions continue to spill out of the history books and into debates over trade, technology and intelligence sharing. Although Japan and South Korea are taking steps to repair their relationship, progress remains uncertain. Leaders in both countries face political challenges at home that could make it harder for them to reach compromises abroad, and the disputes are deeply rooted in questions about national honor and responsibility for some of Asia\u2019s worst atrocities. South Korea believes it is entitled to additional compensation from Japan and a more fulsome acceptance of guilt. Japanese leaders have resisted, saying such issues have already been settled. The United States is prodding both sides to compromise as it tries to refocus its alliances to counter China\u2019s growing strength. Harris, whose four-day trip to the region was anchored bythe state funeralfor former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, told reporters she views American foreign policy in the region \u201cin the context of a trilateral relationship,\u201d with the U.S., Japan and South Korea all working together. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Harris encouraged the South Korean and Japanese leaders to advance their negotiations during her meetings with them. The U.S. wants \u201cto see two of our closest allies in the world working even better with each other,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re gratified to see that both countries seem determined to address those issues with a real vigor,\u201d the official said. However, the official said the U.S. had a limited role to play. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to mediate or negotiate or broker what that relationship should look like,\u201d the official said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishidasat down with each otherlast week at the United Nations, the first meeting between leaders of the two countries in three years. Then on Wednesday, South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo met with Kishida after Abe\u2019s funeral and described their countries as \u201cclose neighbors and cooperative partners who share the values of democracy and the principles of the market economy.\u201d Kristi Govella, deputy director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said the U.S. will struggle to achieve its goals if South Korea and Japan don\u2019t work together. \u201cBroadly, the three countries share the same concerns, but the willingness and capacity to act aren\u2019t always aligned between the three,\u201d she said. There\u2019s an increasing focus on the tensions because of concerns about Taiwan, where Chinese and American saber rattling has raised fears of conflict. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit in August outraged Beijing, which responded with military exercises. President Joe Biden recently said the U.S. would send troops if China attacked. Although Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, Beijing views the island as part of its territory and has vowed to unite it with the mainland. Harris accused China of \u201ca pressure campaign against Taiwan\u201d with \u201ca series of destabilizing actions.\u201d \u201cWe anticipate continued aggressive behavior from Beijing as it attempts to unilaterally undermine the status quo,\u201d she said Wednesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin responded to Harris by saying the U.S. had violated its pledge to respect China\u2019s territorial integrity. \u201cWhen the U.S. cannot honor its own commitment, in what position can it talk about rules and order? It will only become a saboteur of international rules,\u201d Wang said in a daily briefing. Zack Cooper, a senior fellow focused on Asian defense strategy at the American Enterprise Institute, said \u201cthere\u2019s a feeling that the likelihood of a serious crisis over Taiwan is growing pretty rapidly.\u201d Fractures among American allies could undermine any response to an invasion, said Fang-Yu Chen, a political science professor at Soochow University in Taipei, Taiwan. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have good relationships with each other, then there will be trouble,\u201d he said. Ties between South Korea and Japan worsened during the leadership of Abe and former South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Abe\u2019s government reacted furiously after South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court in 2018 upheld lower court verdicts and ordered Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate Korean forced laborers. Those rulings led to further tensions in 2019 when Japan placed export controls on chemicals vital to South Korea\u2019s semiconductor industry. Citing the deterioration of trust, Japan also removed South Korea from a list of countries with preferential trade status. Moon\u2019s government accused Abe of weaponizing trade and downgraded Japan\u2019s trade status in a tit-for-tat move. Seoul even threatened to terminate a military intelligence-sharing agreement with Tokyo that was a major symbol of their three-way security cooperation with Washington. South Korea eventually backed off and continued the deal under pressure from former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which until then had seemed content to let the U.S. allies escalate their feud. Experts say the Japanese export controls had limited impact on South Korea\u2019s semiconductor industry, partially because of successful South Korean efforts to diversify their sources of chemicals and materials. But there are concerns that Japan could respond with further economic retaliation if South Korean courts approve a process to liquidate local assets of Japanese companies that have been refusing court orders to offer reparations to South Korean forced labor victims. That would undermine U.S. hopes for expanding computer chip manufacturing in allied countries, strengthening delicate supply chains and countering China\u2019s own technology investments.Harris met with Japanese business executiveson Wednesday and said \u201cno one country can satisfy the globe\u2019s demand\u201d and \u201cit is important that we and our allies partner and coordinate.\u201d Japan insists all wartime compensation issues were settled under a 1965 treaty normalizing relations between the two nations that included hundreds of millions of dollars in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul. Yoon, the South Korean president who took office in May, has expressed hope for finding a way to resolve the compensation issue without \u201ccausing a clash between the sovereignties.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear what kind of compromise the countries could reach as South Korean plaintiffs have been rejecting the idea of receiving compensation from the South Korean government instead of Japanese companies. Kishida also says both countries need to improve ties because of the worsening security environment in the region, although Japanese officials insist that Seoul should be the one to make the first step and propose plans acceptable to Japan. Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University,wrote recentlythat Japan and South Korea are being nudged closer together by threats including North Korea. However, he said both countries will need to make compromises for their cooperation \u2014 and their alliances with the U.S. \u2014 to reach their full potential. \u201cTrue trilateral cooperation, even with the strategic imperatives, depends on resolving the profound disputes over wartime history and justice,\u201d he wrote. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo and Kim reported from Seoul.",

    "Senators push new oversight to combat federal prison crises": [
        "By MICHAEL R. SISAK and MICHAEL BALSAMOSeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation Wednesday to overhaul oversight and bring greater transparency to the crisis-plagued federal Bureau of Prisonsfollowing reporting from The Associated Press that exposed systemic corruptionin the federal prison system and increased congressional scrutiny. The bill, called the Federal Prison Oversight Act, would require the Justice Department to create a prisons ombudsman to field complaints about prison conditions, and would compel the department\u2019s inspector general to evaluate risks and abuses at all 122 federal prison facilities. The bill, sponsored by Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Mike Braun, R-Ind., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is being introduced a day beforeBureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters is scheduled to testifybefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Durbin chairs. Ossoff, Braun and Durbin are three founding members of the Senate Bipartisan Prison Policy Working Group. The panel launched in February amid turmoil at the Bureau of Prisons, much of it uncovered by AP reporting, includingrampant sexual abuseand othercriminal misconduct by staff, chronicunderstaffing,escapesanddeaths. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that BOP has been plagued by misconduct,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cOne investigation after another has revealed a culture of abuse, mismanagement, corruption, torture, and death that reaches to the highest levels. And yet it still operates without any meaningful independent oversight. The result has been catastrophic for both incarcerated people and staff.\u201d A companion bill in the House is sponsored by Reps. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D. and Reps. Lucy McBath, D-Ga. Under the Federal Prison Oversight Act, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general would be required to conduct risk-based inspections of all federal prison facilities, provide recommendations to address deficiencies and assign each facility a risk score. Higher-risk facilities would then receive more frequent inspections. The inspector general would also be required to report findings and recommendations to Congress and the public, and the Bureau of Prisons would then need to respond with a corrective action plan within 60 days. A prison ombudsman would be established to take complaints \u2014 via a secure hotline and online form \u2014 and investigate and report to the attorney general and Congress dangerous conditions affecting the health, safety, welfare and rights of inmates and staff. A spokesman for the Justice Department said Wednesday that the agency was reviewing the legislation. A spokesperson for Inspector General Michael Horowitz declined to comment. The reforms have the backing of a wide array of groups involved in the federal prison system and across the political spectrum, including the correctional officers\u2019 union, the inmate advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the American Conservative Union and the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity. \u201cFamilies with incarcerated loved ones for years have been calling for greater transparency, safety and accountable from our federal prisons,\u201d FAMM President Kevin Ring said. \u201cThe bipartisan bill introduced today answers their calls.\u201d Shane Fausey, the president of the Council of Prison Locals union, is also scheduled to testify Thursday, along with the former head of Pennsylvania\u2019s state prison system, John Wetzel, and Cecilia Cardenas, a former federal inmate. Ossoff has been leading an investigation of the Bureau of Prisons as chair of the Senate Homeland Security panel\u2019s subcommittee on investigations. Recent hearings have spotlighted misconduct and abuse at a federal penitentiary in Atlanta and the Justice Department\u2019s failure to properly account for in-custody deaths. In July, Ossoff and the panel\u2019s top Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., grilledthen-Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal as he refused to accept responsibilityfor a culture of corruption and misconduct that has plagued his agency for years. \u201cMy 10-month bipartisan investigation of corruption, abuse, and misconduct in the Federal prison system revealed an urgent need to overhaul federal prison oversight. I am bringing Democrats and Republicans together to crack down on corruption, strengthen public safety, and protect civil rights,\u201d Ossoff said.",

    "Supreme Court keeping live audio as it opens again to public": [
        "By JESSICA GRESKOSeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court saysit will continue providing live audio broadcastsof arguments in cases, even as it welcomes the public back to its courtroom for a new term that begins Monday. The justices began providing live audio of arguments after the courtclosed to the public in March of 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Monday will be the first time in more than two and a half years that the justices will hear arguments with members of the public present. Chief Justice John Roberts hadsaid earlier this monththat the public would be allowed back in October, following the court\u2019s summer break. But the court had not announced specifics or said what would happen to the audio feed of arguments the court has been providing through its website. Before the pandemic, audio of arguments was generally available only several days after they took place. On Wednesday the high court announced that the building would still remain closed to visitors \u201cuntil further notice\u201d outside oral arguments, which are scheduled on four days in October. Members of the public who attend on those days will not be required to wear masks. The court at first postponed arguments entirely in 2020 because of virus concerns but went on tohear them by phonefor more than a year and a half. The justices returned toin-person sessions without the publicin the fall of last year and heard their entire last term without being open to the public. That included big cases in which they ultimatelyexpanded gun rightsandstripped away women\u2019s constitutional protections for abortion. Aside from arguing lawyers, only the justices\u2019 law clerks, court staff and journalists who cover the court were allowed to be at argument sessions, and for a time there were mask and testing requirements. On the first day of the new term Monday the court will hear cases involvingthe nation\u2019s main anti-water pollution law, the Clean Water Act, and a dispute between states over unclaimed money. Big cases already on the docket this term include one challenging the role ofrace in college admissionsand another that could further weaken theVoting Rights Act. The court looks different from the last time the public was allowed to see the justices on the bench, with two new justices.Justice Amy Coney Barrett joinedthe court following thedeath of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020. And Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice,joined the courtfollowing the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer in June. The changes mean that for the first time a majority of the justices are not white men, and for the first time four women are sitting together on the court. The justices will hold an invitation-only ceremonial investiture for Jackson in their courtroom on Friday.",

    "US: Focus new Russia sanctions on oil revenue, arms supplies": [
        "By ELLEN KNICKMEYERSeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Future sanctions over President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine must focus on depriving Putin of what he needs to fund and fight the war: revenue from Russia\u2019s oil and gas sales and access to global supply networks to replenish his military, two architects of the Biden administration\u2019s sanctions campaign told lawmakers on Wednesday. While calling for stronger action against Russia, the State and Treasury department officials appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee faced complaints from both Democrats and Republicans that the first rounds of sanctions did not hit Moscow as hard or fast as the administration had forecast. \u201cWhat we were told was these were going to be the toughest sanctions ever on a country. That they were going to have certain impacts,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, recounting early predictions from administration officials that the sanctions would plunge the country into recession, send the value of the ruble plunging, and trigger unrest among Russians. \u201cAnd we have not seen the full impact that was described to us. \u201cThe frustration is we know that while we\u2019re playing the long game, Ukrainians are dying,\u201d Shaheen added. Putin has vowed to press his offensive in Ukraine despite battlefield losses to motivated and NATO-supplied Ukrainian forces. Within the past week, Russia has started calling up hundreds of thousands of civilian men to replenish its depleted forces in Ukraine and held sham referendums in Russian-occupied territory, as an expected prelude to claiming those lands for Russia. In response to those referendums, the U.S. and its allies are preparing new sanctions that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday would impose a \u201csevere economic cost on Russia when they move forward with annexation.\u201d Senators and the two Biden administration officials \u2014 Elizabeth Rosenberg, an assistant Treasury secretary, and James O\u2019Brien, head of the State Department\u2019s sanction coordination office \u2014 focused Wednesday on additional penalties aimed at making it impossible for Russia to keep prosecuting the war. Adroit financial management by Russian officials and, above all, billions of dollars of windfall profits from oil and gas exports have buffered the impact of the sanctions imposed by the United States and about 30 other nations. Sanctions so far have targeted Russia\u2019s financial institutions, businesses, military and high-tech industries, and thousands of officials and other members of the Russian elite. Rosenberg told lawmakers that Russia should be in fiscal deficit by the end of the year. But Russia\u2019s currency is managing far better than the U.S. projected, and its inflation and stock market troubles aren\u2019t out of line with other countries\u2019, in a rough year overall for the world\u2019s economy, Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, pointed out. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as crippling as we thought on Russia,\u201d Romney said of the international sanctions, which, with arms supplies for Ukraine, form the core of the West\u2019s support for Ukraine. That might serve as a cautionary lesson when the U.S. considers sanctions in the future, Romney argued. Rosenberg stressed that the U.S. should be \u201claser-focused\u201d on starving Russia of the energy profits that are keeping the war and its economy going. Russia is a leading global exporter of oil and natural gas. U.S. and European officials are rushing to complete plans for a system of price caps on Russian maritime oil exports. The system would be designed to keep Russian oil on the world market, to avoid driving up prices even higher, while forcing down the price that Russia gets for its exports. Next in importance, the sanctions officials said, was doubling down on the global arms procurement networks Russia is using to replenish its weapons and technology for the war in Ukraine. Already, Russia is fielding older and older equipment on the battlefield, turning to Iran for drones, and, reportedly, cannibalizing commercial high-tech to keep military hardware running, O\u2019Brien said. Lawmakers and the sanctions officials also talked of better coordinating existing U.S. and European Union sanctions to close loopholes, of unspecified future measures against Russia\u2019s \u201csoft power,\u201d and of sanctions on human rights abusers in the Russian military. \u201cWe appreciate what you do,\u201d Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican and ranking member of the committee, told the sanctions organizers. \u201cWe want you to double your efforts in this regard. Because you\u2019re the ones that can really help bring this thing to an end.\u201d",

    "Vaccine appears to protect against monkeypox, CDC says": [
        "By AMANDA SEITZSeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 At-risk people who received a single dose of the monkeypox vaccine in U.S. efforts against the virus appeared to be significantly less likely to get sick, public health officials announced Wednesday, even as they urged a second dose for full protection. It was the first look public health officials have offered into howthe Jynneos vaccineis affecting monkeypox, a virus that is primarily spread among men who have sex with infected men. \u201cThese new data provide us with a level of cautious optimism that the vaccine is working as intended,\u201d Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday. Roughly 800,000 first and second doses of the vaccine have been administered across the country to people who are considered high risk for becoming infected with the virus, White House National Monkeypox Response Coordinator Bob Fenton said. There is no scientifically conclusive data available to prove effectiveness of the Jynneos vaccine against monkeypox. But the CDC\u2019s new real-world figures show that unvaccinated men, between the ages 18 and 49 who were considered eligible for the vaccine, were 14 times as likely to become infected with monkeypox as those who had one dose at least two weeks earlier. The data came from 32 states for cases between July 31 through Sept. 3. Still, Walensky said, lab studies show the highest level of immunity from the virus is reached after people get a second dose of the vaccine, calling it \u201creally important.\u201d The U.S. leads the world in monkeypox cases. So far more than 25,000 infections of the virus, which can cause rash, fever, body aches and chills, have been reported. The country suffered from early problems in its response, with U.S. officials struggling to distribute the vaccine after the first case was detected in May. As some cities and counties tried tostretch the limited supply thissummer they stopped offering the recommended second dose of the shot. Now, public health officials are trying to catch up, reminding people to get their second dose. About 150,000 second doses had been administered as of Sept. 17,according to CDC. \u201cWe\u2019re really asking providers to do outreach to get people their second doses,\u201d Walensky said. Public health officials also announced changes Wednesday to who is eligible for the vaccine and how they can get it. The new CDC guidance is intended to reach more people who might be at risk for monkeypox exposure. The guidance makes gay, bisexual men and transgender people who have had more than one sexual partner in the past six months eligible for the vaccine. It also allows the vaccine to be administered on the shoulder or upper back so marks from the shot can be covered with clothing. The number of new monkeypox cases has declined in recent weeks, but there are signs of worseningracial disparities,with Black people making up roughly 47 percent of new cases reported the week of Sept. 11.",

        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Republican leaderMitch McConnellsaid Wednesday that he believes his party now has a \u201c50-50 shot\u201d of getting the chamber back less than six weeks away from themidterm elections. \u201cWe are in a bunch of close races,\u201d McConnell told reporters during a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really, really close either way, in my view.\u201d The comments reflect a greater degree of optimism from the GOP leader after he drew criticism last month from fellow Republicans when he downplayed the party\u2019s chances in the fall elections, saying it would be more likely for the party to gain control of the House than the Senate. \u201cSenate races are just different \u2014 they\u2019re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,\u201d McConnell said at a press conference in Florence, Kentucky, in mid-August. For the past year, McConnell has been careful about overstating any GOP gains in the chamber, and he previously criticized the \u201cquality\u201d of candidates in key races like Arizona. Republicans have been pleading with him to help direct money to lift Blake Masters, the GOP candidate for Senate there. So far, McConnell has refused to publicly do so. But on Wednesday, McConnell seemed to suggest there is a slight chance for the GOP to control House and Senate in January \u2014 mainly due to the rising issue of inflation, which his party blames on Democrats\u2019 \u201creckless spending\u201d in Washington. McConnell and his counterpart in the House, Kevin McCarthy, have pledged to focus on \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues like rising costs and crime. The political dynamics in the final six weeks of the midterms are proving volatile and could ultimately help either party in tight races. Democrats have focused much of their message on reproductive rights for women after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this summer invalidating a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion. Republicans, meanwhile, have centered their campaigns on inflation and combatting violent crime. Many in the GOP have also parroted former PresidentDonald Trump\u2019slies that the 2020 election was stolen from him, a contention that has been roundly rejected by courts and election officials. Democrats are coming out of the summer buoyed by signs that the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision may galvanize voters in the fall. Voters in deeply Republican Kansas overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have curtailed abortion rights. And surprise wins for Democrats in special elections from Alaska to upstate New York also signaled notable energy on the issue. But the challenge for the party will be keeping those voters engaged through November. McConnell on Wednesday seemed less worried that abortion would significantly erode GOP gains. \u201cI think that issue is playing out in different ways in different states,\u201d McConnell said when asked if Republicans were concerned about it. \u201cThe three big national issues that we\u2019re going to be addressing here that people are most concerned about nationally are the ones that I mentioned: inflation, crime and open borders.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re going to be putting the focus on,\u201d he added. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, largely echoed McConnell\u2019s predictions on Wednesday, suggesting that Democrats were focusing on \u201cshiny objects.\u201d \u201cMy experience through the years, even in years when we\u2019ve been protecting incumbents in a bad environment, is that when the fundamentals of an election lock in and for the voters the issues get clarified, it usually does kind of generate a bit of momentum for one side or the other,\u201d Thune told reporters. \u201cAnd honestly, I think that happens for us this year. I just think that the pocketbook issues are going to be paramount and all these other issues Democrats are trying to shift attention to are kind of shiny objects.\u201d \u201cBut in the end,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s the economy, the cost of food, the cost of gas, security, where people feel safe in their neighborhoods and communities.\u201d __ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "US announces $1.1 billion more in military aid for Ukraine": [
        "By LOLITA C. BALDOR and MATTHEW LEESeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. will provide an additional $1.1 billion in aid to Ukraine, with funding for 18 more advanced rocket systems and other weapons to counter drones that Russia has been using against Ukrainian troops, the Biden administration announced Wednesday. The latest package is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds contracts to purchase weapons and equipment. And it brings the total of U.S. aid to Ukraine to nearly $17 billion since the Biden administration took office. The aid announcement comes as Russia moves to annex parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine that held Kremlin-orchestrated referendums on living under Moscow\u2019s rule. The votes were denounced by Kyiv and the West as illegal and rigged. \u201cWe will not be deterred from supporting Ukraine, we will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people, and provide them with the security assistance they need to defend themselves, for as long as it takes,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Since the funding is for contracts for weapons and equipment, it is aimed at helping Ukraine secure its longer-term defense needs. It could take a year or two for Ukraine to get the systems. The U.S. has used Pentagon drawdown authority to provide weapons more immediately, and another announcement for that Defense Department aid is expected early next week. The package includes funding for 18 of the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, and ammunition for them, and 12 Titan systems, which are used to counter drones. Officials have said the HIMARS and other similar systems were key to Ukraine\u2019s battle successes in recent weeks. And the Russians have been using Iranian-made drones to target Ukrainian forces, underscoring the need for more systems to counter that threat. Also in the package is funding for about 300 vehicles, dozens of trucks and trailers to transport heavy equipment, a variety of radars, communications and surveillance equipment, and other gear for soldiers. It also will include funding for equipment to detect explosives and for maintenance and training. A senior defense official said it will take six months to two years to get most of those weapons and equipment to Ukraine, and \u201ca few years\u201d for the additional HIMARS to arrive. The official said the 18 HIMARS are an investment in Ukraine\u2019s future defense, and said the contract does not rule out other U.S. efforts to send additional HIMARS more quickly through the faster Pentagon drawdown program. Senior defense and military officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity Wednesday to provide details of the aid package and a military assessment of the war. The war, now in its seventh month, has shifted to a new phase, as Russia tries to rebound from recent combat losses and use the referendums to politically solidify the gains it had made in the four occupied regions in the south and east. Pro-Russia officials in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions said Wednesday they would ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to incorporate their provinces into Russia. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the administrative process would unfold. Jean-Pierre said the U.S. has determined that Russia falsified the results of the referendums, which it said showed overwhelming support for annexation. \u201cThese so called referenda have been an exercise in coercion and disinformation, executed by puppet authorities following orders from Russia,\u201d she said. Jean-Pierre signaled that the White House was preparing new sanctions against Russia in response to the referendums, saying the U.S. and its allies planned to impose a \u201csevere economic cost on Russia when they move forward with annexation.\u201d A senior military official said the U.S. has seen the first portions of Russia\u2019s latest mobilization of reservists move into Ukraine. But so far it\u2019s just been small numbers of them, the official said. Russia has announced plans to call up about 300,000 men with past military service, in the wake of widespread battlefield losses in Ukraine\u2019s recent counteroffensive. In response, tens of thousands of Russian men have fled the country to border nations in the past week, fearing that Putin\u2019s mobilization will be much broader and more arbitrary than he has suggested. There are numerous reports of men with no military training and of all ages receiving draft notices. The U.S. military official said Putin may find it difficult to generate 300,000 forces, and noted that troops who are needed to train the new conscripts are already fighting in Ukraine, raising questions about their ability to handle the tasks.",

    "Records contradict Majewski\u2019s account of military punishment": [
        "By BRIAN SLODYSKO and JAMES LAPORTASeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican J.R. Majewski has centered his campaign for a competitive Ohio congressional seat around hisbiography as an Air Force veteran. But one of the big questions that has surfaced is why Majewski was told he could not reenlist in the Air Force after his initial four years were up. Majewski\u2019s campaign said last week that he was punished and demoted after getting in a \u201cbrawl\u201d in an Air Force dormitory in 2001.Military records obtained since thenby The Associated Press, however, offer a different account of the circumstances, which military legal experts say would have played a significant role in the decision to bar him from reenlisting. They indicate Majewski\u2019s punishment and demotion were the result of him being stopped for driving drunk on a U.S. air base in Japan in September 2001. The documents, which were provided to the AP and independently authenticated, present yet another instance where the recorded history of Majewski\u2019s service diverges from what he has told voters as he campaigns while using his veteran status as a leading credential. In a statement, Majewski acknowledged that he was punished for drunken driving, though he didn\u2019t address why his campaign previously said his demotion was the result of a fight. \u201cThis mistake is now more than 20 years old. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all done something as young adults that we look back on and wonder \u2018what was I thinking?\u2019 and I\u2019m sure our parents and grandparents share these sentiments,\u201d Majewski said. Since starting his campaign to unseat longtime Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Majewski has repeatedly said he was a combat veteran who served a tour of duty under \u201ctough\u201d circumstances in Afghanistan. By his own account, he once went more than 40 days in the country without a shower due to a lack of running water. His story came under intense scrutiny last week when the AP, citing military documents obtained through public records requests, reported that he did not deploy to Afghanistan as he claimed, but instead spent six months based in Qatar, a longtime U.S. ally, where he helped load and unload aircraft. The latest revelation that Majewski was demoted for drunken driving adds another wrinkle. Last week, the AP asked Majewski\u2019s campaign why his military service records showed that he was not allowed to reenlist in the Air Force and left the service after four years at a rank that was one notch above where he started. At the time, his campaign said in an email that Majewski was \u201cin a fight in the dormitory with another servicemember\u201d which \u201cknocked his rank down.\u201d His campaign added that he later gained some of that rank back. The personnel records obtained by the AP make no mention of a fight. Instead, they state that Majewski was demoted for drunken driving at Kadena Air Base in Japan on Sept. 8, 2001. And rather than gain his rank back \u2014 as Majewski\u2019s campaign said \u2014 the records indicated he continued to hold the rank of E-2, one notch above entry level, that he was demoted to for the rest of his active duty. \u201cWhen you decided to get behind the wheel of a vehicle after indulging in intoxicating liquor you brought discredit upon yourself, 733rd Air Mobility Squadron, and the Air Force,\u201d the disciplinary records state, referring to the unit Majewski was assigned to at the time. \u201cFurther misconduct by you of any type will not be tolerated.\u201d The three-page document details Majewski\u2019s punishment, which included a reprimand and 30 days of extra duty in addition to the demotion. It bears Majewski\u2019s signature and shows he consulted a lawyer and waived his right to a court-martial. He also waived his right to appeal the punishment and requested that the document not become public, the records show. The AP was not able to obtain a \u201cwritten presentation\u201d from Majewski, which was referred to in the disciplinary paperwork. The campaign did not respond to a request from the AP to provide the document. Eric Mayer, a former West Point graduate and Army infantry officer later turned military lawyer, reviewed Majewski\u2019s documents at AP\u2019s request. He said that \u201cthe overall nature and quality of (Majewski\u2019s) military service can be severely questioned simply by virtue of the fact that he got out as a E-2 after four years.\u201d \u201cBasically, his commanding officer told him as long as he behaves himself for the next six months, he won\u2019t demote him down all the way to airman basic,\u201d Mayer said, referring to the entry-level rank Majewski could have held if he got into more trouble. Mayer also noted that Majewski was given additional duties in his punishment that generally involve \u201carea beautification\u201d and janitorial services. In some cases, a DUI can be a career-ending violation in the military. But three days after Majewski was pulled over, the U.S. was suddenly at war following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Within months, Majewski was reassigned and deployed to Qatar, which served as the staging ground for operations in Afghanistan, records show. Military records show Majewski\u2019s only deployment was to Qatar. Last Friday, during a defiant news conference,he insisted that he did indeed serve in Afghanistan, though he declined to offer specifics because he said the details were \u201cclassified.\u201d But there is a difference between deploying to a country and touching down there. Majewski previously said he was a \u201ccombat veteran\u201d who deployed to Afghanistan, a term that conveys he received orders assigning him to a specific base in the country. Majewski previously said he could not discuss flights he says he took to Afghanistan because they were \u201cclassified.\u201d In his statement Wednesday, he said he was aboard \u201coutbound transport flights to forward bases and combat zones throughout the Middle East, including Afghanistan\u201d though he acknowledged that he was stationed in Qatar. He also described his experience joining the Air Force at the age 20 as fulfilling, yet challenging. \u201cLike any young serviceman away from family in a foreign land and with an assignment schedule in continual motion, it came with periods of difficulty and personal challenges,\u201d Majewski said. \u201cI lost my grandmother, who I loved very deeply, and it was tough work. I am proud of my service and the experiences that made me who I am today, but I have never once claimed to have undergone a \u2018tough combat tour\u2019 in Afghanistan or suggested that I was engaged in active firefights.\u201d Majewski\u2019s campaign has previously promoted him as a \u201ccombat veteran.\u201d During anAugust 2021 interviewon the One American Podcast, Majewski said that he had a \u201ctough time in life\u201d while serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan. He echoed that claim in otherinterviews unearthedby the liberal group Media Matters. Majewski\u2019s claim that he couldn\u2019t discuss his forays to Afghanistan because the details were \u201cclassified\u201d was a red flag to those who investigate cases of \u201cstolen valor.\u201d \u201cThe No. 1 trope that comes out of people when they are either fabricating a military record or, in this case, embellishing a record is they fall back to, \u2018It\u2019s classified,\u2019\u201d said Ed Caffrey, a former Air Force master sergeant who now investigates \u201cstolen valor\u201d cases and teaches journalism at Eastern New Mexico University. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s no junior enlisted air transportation specialist who was doing something so secret that 20 years later it still needs to be classified.\u201d Majewksi\u2019s campaign declined a request to put the AP in touch with those he served with who could vouch that he went to Afghanistan. But he has posted several pages of records to social media that he said back up his claims. Military experts consulted by the AP say the records prove no such thing. \u201cThe AP stated that I had only been deployed to Qatar. My records show my deployment location as classified. In addition, they forgot my deployment to Camp Hialeah in Korea (which is now closed),\u201d Majewski said in one tweet, which contained two separate documents. One of the documents included in the tweet was a \u201ctemporary duty assignment\u201d in early 2001 to South Korea, which are not orders to deploy as Majewski claimed. Key details including the purpose of the trip and its duration were also blurred out in the photo Majewski posted. Additionally, the document\u2019s inclusion of the phrases \u201ctop secret\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d were references to the security clearances held by Majewski and the noncommissioned officer he traveled with, Air Force experts say. That officer, whose name is redacted, had a \u201ctop secret\u201d clearance; Majewski had a \u201csecret\u201d clearance. Members of the military typically need security clearances to do their jobs. The other document included in the tweet, which does not show a date, indicated Majewski had been medically cleared to go on a different temporary assignment to a \u201cclassified\u201d location. Experts say such forms often list a service member\u2019s destination as classified as a matter of routine. \u201cThe reason that it says \u2018classified\u2019 is not because he\u2019s going to some top secret black ops location,\u201d Caffrey said. \u201cIt says classified because that\u2019s a non-secured form. He\u2019s taking that form around with him to different places on base where people who put eyes on it may not have security clearances to see what he\u2019s doing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s (operations security). They don\u2019t want everyone and their brother to know where he\u2019s going. That\u2019s not something you want out in the general public,\u201d Caffrey added. Even as scrutiny of Majewski intensifies, he has given no indication that he intends to drop out of the race and has continued to campaign. \u201cI have nothing to hide,\u201d Majewski said at the end of a brief news conference Friday. ___ LaPorta reported from Wilmington, North Carolina. ___ Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ap_politics",

    "Report urges improvements in US approach to hostage cases": [
        "By ERIC TUCKERSeptember 28, 2022 GMT",
        " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration should create an additional senior-level position at the White House National Security Council to focus on cases of Americans who are wrongfully detained in foreign countries, and give more power and funding to an FBI-led interagency office tasked with helping free hostages, according to a report Wednesday from a leading advocacy group. The report from the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation also recommends that Congress authorize funding to pay for hostage families to visit Washington to meet with U.S. government officials, as well as to provide support \u2014 whether clothing, temporarily housing or medical care \u2014 for returning hostages. The annual research report is based on interviews with 60 people, including former hostages and wrongful detainees and their relatives as well as former government officials. It was released amid heightened public attention on the plight of American hostages and detainees, thanks in part to thecontinued imprisonment in Russia of WNBA star Brittney Grineron drug-related charges. The U.S. has been trying to bring home Griner another American jailed in Russia,Paul Whelan, but those efforts have so far not been successful. There have been some high-profile releases in the last six months,including an April prisoner swap with Russia that secured the release of Marine veteran Trevor Reedand adeal with the Taliban that last week freed an American contractor, Mark Frerichs, who hadbeen abducted in Afghanistan more than two years ago. Two Americans, including an oil executive,were released from Venezuelan government custodyin March, thoughCaracas is continuing to hold numerous other Americans. In addition,family members of detainees have demonstrated in recent months outside the White Houseand in New York, and a mural unveiled this summer in Washington depicting faces of Americans jailed abroad has added to the publicity. Yet more than 60 Americans are still being held hostage or wrongfully detained, and the report\u2019s authors say such cases appear tougher to resolve than they were a decade ago. Nearly half of the U.S. nationals who are still held hostage have been held for more than five years, the report says. The report also says the number of countries holding Americans captives has grown over the last decade, totaling 19 in 2022. Seventy-five percent of currently detained Americans are being held by China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela, the report says. The Biden administration has said publicly that it regards the release of hostages as a top priority, though officials have also noted that such resolutions can involve difficult decisions \u2014 particularly in the case of prisoner swaps involving lawfully convicted felons in the U.S. \u2014 and that the U.S. is not the only country with a say in the matter. In the case of Griner and Whelan, for instance, the administration says it has not received a productive response from Russia to a substantial offer it made several months ago for their release. The report makes 10 recommendations, including empowering and funding the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, a unit based at FBI headquarters but comprised of representatives from different agencies. Because the interagency cell is led by the FBI, the report says, it creates the perception that the unit operates on the FBI\u2019s behalf rather than the whole of government. It recommends that the cell be supervised by rotating leaders from across different agencies, \u201cso it can remain neutral, impactful, and influential across the interagency,\u201d and that the Biden administration consider relocating it away from the FBI and elevating the position of director to a more senior role. The White House does already have senior administration officials dedicated to detainee and hostage cases, including a director for counterterrorism for hostage and detainee affairs. But the report envisions the creation of a new, high-level position at the National Security Council under the title of deputy assistant to the president and special coordinator for detentions. The person would also engage with regional directorates within the NSC to make sure that hostage and detainee concerns are prioritized alongside other diplomatic considerations \u2014 interests that can sometimes be in conflict. \u201cIn addition,\u201d the report says, \u201chaving direct access to the president is critical to ensure that wrongful detainee issues are better prioritized and understood.\u201d The foundation was named after James Foley,a freelance journalist who was among a group of Westerners brutally murderedin Islamic State captivity in Syria in 2014. Two British IS militants,El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey,have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty by a jury in connection with those deaths and are serving life sentences. The murders of Foley and other Americans reshaped the U.S. government\u2019s approach to hostage-taking, spurring the creation of the fusion cell as well as a new office within the State Department known as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. _____ Follow Eric Tucker at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",
